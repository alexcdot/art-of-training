(Embodying the Dao)The Dao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Dao,"Trodden lands are those that are difficult to cross or that are difficult to maintain. The easiest way to conquer this land is to ambush or infiltrate the land, building walls and creating distractions to keep the enemy from finding you. If you can build surprise and confusion, keeping the enemy out of your defenses is a must. Building walls and creating distractions also has many advantages, including preventing further attacks."
"The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. (Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth","When attacking from a position of superior height, always remember to defend. A"
"(conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all things. Always without desire we must be found,If its deep mystery we would sound",Understand the risks and rewards. Do not place too much value on the unknown nor too little on the potential.
"But if desire always within us be,Its outer fringe is all that we shall see. Under these two aspects, it is really the same","Where something seems bright and apparent, it needs to be carefully seen. Where it seems natural and natural it must be carefully considered. You should only use things that seem natural and natural when they have a place in the overall design."
"but as development takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery","If you understand the principles of physics and how they relate to the life of a body, then you will be able to design and develop replacement parts, helmets and lives-preserves. You will also be able to use these to develop new life-preserves and life-replenishments. In business, you can design and develop strategies and strategies that work for both yourself and your competitors. In this way, you can gain competitive advantage and market your strategies. It is a science that has many practitioners, managers and strategists. It is also a very powerful way"
"(The nourishment of the person)All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is","The essence of a well-fed army is its energy, which can be used for many purposes. Look for the troops who are energized and ready for battle. If you can catch their undulations and constellations, you can use them in your own spying. In business, you can use their information to set competitive campaigns. On the battlefield, your troops will cheer you on. In your own secret services, you can keep them informed and on their toes. They will love you and care for you. This is true both inside and out. There is much in the way of personal and collective intelligence in business. It can be helpful to understand and use this."
"they all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the want of skill is","This is important because if you know what to expect, you can plan and prepare successfully for the possible attack. The skill of the skilful also means you know how to survive, both in the field and in the field of battle. If you know how to attack, you may be able to defeat a superior force in one day."
So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to (the idea of) the other,"Places on Earth that have naturally fertile and fertile periods, such as mountains, are likely to spring and turn into rivers when the weather allows. The fertile places hence may become swamps or can even become vast metropolises. This is what happens when there are no other natural resources and no other means of life."
that difficulty and ease produce the one (the idea of) the other. that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other,"There are many routes to victory, from defeating an invading force to sweeping an army across the field. The more difficult a route, the stronger its chance of success. In business, it is sometimes better to use cheaper and more accessible routes."
that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other,"Compare the contrast of two using the principle of contrast. In the first place, contrast is not about strength of character. It represents weakness, discrimination, lightness and so on. In the second place, contrast arises from discrimination, lightness from lightness and so on. In the third place, discrimination arises from lightness from darkness and so on. In the fourth place, lightness arises from darkness from aang-glad attack, a problem that confronts us all. In the fifth place, attack arises from a defeat, a problem that must be overcome."
that the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another,"This is what sounds like harmony, right? Well, it may not be. If you make sounds that are harmonious with respect to a single point, such as a high chime that whips down on a vulnerable target or a low kick that shakes the ground, then those may be harmonious with plenty of other people around you. But if you give sounds that are not harmonious to a group and others see them, then those who would normally be shocked may be startled. Sometimes the ability to sense harmony may be quite important. In this way, some may be persuaded that there is harmony in the sounds they make. These people may be persuaded that the sounds they make have a particular meaning for them.>
<|startoftext|>~^~@If the soldiers are not honest with you, and you do not see their true colors, they will say: What do you see? What are you doing? Tell your soldiers this. Tell them that will tell you everything"
and that being before and behind give the idea of one following another,"War is a game of strategy and of taking what you can least possibly have. You should use the least risky, most powerful and most cunning"
"Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and conveys his instructions without the use of speech","When you are not busy conquering an enemy, you should be able to do the things you do not want to the enemy. In business, you can do what you like with less than your will. You can get what you want without having to fight. You can grow and develop your businesses as you see fit. You can win without fighting. You can learn as you grow. But you should always remember that your best strategy may be to both avoid conflict and grow and thrive."
"All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show itself. they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership","It is only when the ground is dry and the sun shines, and the infantry advance, that a thing of danger. If the ground is dry, chances are soldiers will run up and down it. Do not run from a fire. Do not throw stones. Do not punch soldiers. It is better to avoid danger and gain advantage."
"they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a reward for the results)","Experience is about understanding the unknown and taking risks. If you can think of no previous experience then you will have a strong ability in the new environment. New places are never created, they never will be. What you do have is power, knowledge and ability to provide actionable advice."
"The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in it (as an achievement). The work is done, but how no one can see",The worst thing about fear is that it forces you to think twice before you do it. That's why fearful of retribution is so important. Fear of failure is also important. And failure is also why people get fired up about succeeding in the worst ways.
(Keeping the people at rest)Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep the people from rivalry among themselves,"Access to critical points is a critical piece of information. It helps you plan, prepare and respond in a timely fashion. At the same time it gives you a buffer against attack. If you can get access to critical points they provide a useful buffer against mobility and other threats."
not to prize articles which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves,"A good first step is to buy the right items, for example in biological weapons that can be developed over time. You can then develop and market the right weapons, and yet still have a small but significant advantage."
not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to keep their minds from disorder,"Deception is the tendency of people to show particular intent. If they think their apparent desire will lead them to action, then it may be because they are charmed by the thought or other's apparent desire. If they do not see clearly what is likely to excite their desires, then they may be aroused by a false sense of security and fear. If they see clearly their true desires, they may be persuaded by a false and truculent sense of justice. Such deceivers may well become officers and managers. Officers and managers often have a grudge against them and this grudge often lasts into their seniority. Officers and managers often feel unloved and ignored and so they will seek to make their officers and managers as unlikable and ineffective as possible. Leaders and executives often feel unloved and demotivated and so they will seek to make them feel unloved and demotivated. Officers and managers often like playing by the rules and showing surprise to get their way. This can"
"Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones","Setting intent is a skill that can be honed through practice. Knowing when to focus and when not to focus is critical in many situations. Knowing when to break the silence and when to break the law are also critical. 'Numerical intent' is 'using all possible methods to achieve the same result'. Concentrated attention is important here, as it allows you to focus on what you need to do best. When you have 'numerical intent', you do it well. Seeing the future and not just the past provides context for the actions you will take later. Seeing the past causes you to see possibilities other than what you expected, leading you to more action as you see fit. Knowing the future, as well as what you can now expect in the future, gives you a keen sense of urgency and certainty. 'Numerical intent' may be described as 'attention seeking'. It takes a genius for this style to develop. In business, attention seeking is a skill that is"
"He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them from presuming to act (on it)","If you can see them from a distance, and they are unsure whether to attack or not, then you can use their doubts as a means of gaining information. If they are caught in an ambush and cannot respond, then this will mean that the enemy has taken the opportunity of ambush. You can then use their reactions to your advantage. In business, it is often better to stay in the business and focus on your customers rather than trying to win. If you can see the future and know the people who will benefit from your strategy, then you can plan and respond with innovative ideas that people around the world will love to have. For example in the next ten years you could build a market cap which could grow to over a trillion won. This is a good place to start with your most innovative ideas."
(The fountainless)The Dao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel. and in our employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness,"Whilst you can see the depth of enemy territory, you should always stay within your own country. If troops are moving quickly, you should be ready to respond in kind. If not, seek the alternative. Sometimes, even life, is not worth fighting for. So unless you have a better option, seek it. If it is not within your power to defend, then take action."
"How deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things","Ancestry is about connection, family, goals and spirit. Whilst there is great potential in all of these, always seek the connection and the spirit. If you can connect at a high level, you will be highly motivated and likely have an even stronger connection built into your strategy. This is the foundation of Yin and Yang. If you can penetrate deep into the psyche of a subject, you may gain a deeper understanding and perhaps even the ability to create and sustain greater conflicts of loyalty."
"We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of things","To be able to fight is to be able to attack. When you can attack, you have much greater advantage. If you can attack, you have much greater advantage. If you can plunder, use this to your advantage."
"we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into agreement with the obscurity of others","When everyone sees and acts like the other side, the surprise effect will be to advantage. Yet when the other side acts as though you and I were the only ones surprised, the opposite effect can be achieved. The same is true of competitors. If you and I can act like the other side when we see and act like ourselves, the result will be that the result is likely in our favor. It is better to see the other side as more thoughtful and open-minded. If you can see and understand the other side, then the surprise effect will be stronger and you will win. In business, fairness and integrity are important virtues, not just for winning but also for succeeding. As CEO, you have to take risks and take action that is successful."
(The use of emptiness)Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent,"If you want to be benevolent, you must have something good for the world around you. It is better to be able to sustain the world around you than constantly be surrounded by fear. It is better to be emotionally exhausted than constantly be in a state of lethargy. You should seek emotional well-being first, not just in your ends but also in your thoughts."
they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent,"The same is true of animals. If they are cowed, will not fight or go where they wish. Kindness also is not enough. You must love the animals and care for them. Treating them with affection is better than being petulant and treating them badly. Treating them badly also includes fighting or harming them in any way. Compromise is not the same as war, where humanity is at stake. Treating those you love with compassion is the way to go."
they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with. May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows,"When it comes to business, do not let competitors take your place."
"'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power. 'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more. Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see","We can easily see the exhaustion of our troops as the result of overhearing and/or failing to heed other units' orders. In business, it is easy to lose customers as managers may classify or classify competing or competitive actions as failures. The same problem faces us today with falling sales prices. If your CEO or COO can be persuaded to make good on their threats or step down, so much the better. Perhaps the most important skill is in motivating and motivating your workforce."
"(The completion of material forms)The valley spirit dies not, aye the same. The female mystery thus do we name","Setting up camp is a lengthy and hazardous affair. The best way to prepare is to take time to think. When you think things over you have to think harder. More time means more taking. It is better to have more time to think and think harder. Effort is also afoot in war and what you do not put into practice needs to be carefully considered. Effort is the most powerful motivation, for example in fighting or otherwise motivating the enemy. Effort is also a tool for deceiving the enemy or making you believe they are weak. Effort is also a tool for leading by example rather than creating hard and fast plans. If you can walk the fine line between acting and leading, then you may rise above your elders and become the next great leader. In business, careful planning is key. You can make huge money by shifting into smaller roles. A leader needs to be able to see the bigger picture and be able to make strategic decisions. You can do this by: ("
"Its gate, from which at first they issued forth,Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth","The root of the tree of life is in the middle, with time moving inwards. The middle way is always positive, and when you move backwards, you have forward motion. The height of the earth, the seasons, the clouds and the branches of the tree form an angle such that when you rise, you fall. The branches move in all directions, and life in all seasons is experienced in all ways. Trees sustain life by dividing the land into units called fens and taking fens out of them, as well as taking fens out of swamps and ditches. When life is short and the land plentiful, you have time to plant new trees and provide for the army. You can then use the shorter routes to reach your destination. Fens and fenses are opposites, so if you can see and defend a fens or a swamp-ditch, then that part of the army that is in need of protection will be in a rush to the point where"
(Sheathing the light)Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long,"When you need to attack a great height, it is good to have an excellent strait available. If you can block the enemy's way, then you can take many other easy wins. On the other hand, if you are constantly in theity, then you may be slowed or even killed as you run out of energy and so give up. At heights, this is not a good idea as the ground may become slippery or your attacks may be exposed. Stunning heights are dangerous not just because they are difficult but also because of the constant fear of falling. If you can block the enemy's way, then you have a great advantage as they may quickly become trapped and fall into your clutches."
"The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves","If you lived in a world with no weapons, there is little reason to believe your survival would be secure. If you lived in close proximity to a powerful force, such proximity could allow the surviving part of your force to pass over you and cause the death of at least one of you. The same is true in business. If you are able to communicate in a way that keeps competitors guessing, then your competitive position will grow and your bottom line will grow."
"This is how they are able to continue and endure. Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in the foremost place","This is a bit like saying that the military is all-powerful. It may be true that there are many superpowers, but in the end it is all about strategy and strategy. In business you never know when you may face a competitive situation. If you are unprepared for them, you may be defeated."
"he treats his person as if it were foreign to him, and yet that person is preserved","Take time to learn what people really want and want, and how they actually behave. Sometimes people like being treated badly. You can learn something from what they really want and expect. But when people expect things you can hide their expectations. Troops do not want an easy fight. Soldiers see no reason not to fight. Your soldiers will always be with you, even when the war is likely to come. If they do not like your army, they will attack you first, expecting retribution. If you can defeat them first, then they may seek your deaths in the process."
(The placid and contented nature)The highest excellence is like (that of) water,"Water is the flow of water, the readiness of the body for the elements, and the ability of the soldier to move at a rapid speed. It is like the rising of a rising sun. Rising is like rising early in the morning. The best time for rising is from early in the morning to 3:00 a.m. (Pace). Rising also helps with fighting when you have already started."
"The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike","Water is a by-product of the Earth's surface, and is used as a by-product of building and raising. It takes energy to move a stone, and then, with a rapidity often described as 'five to the thousand' (5), you reach your goal."
Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Dao. The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place,"When you want to be seen, admired and imitated, it is important that you are seen and recognized. Recognizing people also has its costs. A more open and open market encourages both businesses and the people to work harder. Finally, open season makes it more difficult for competitors to enter the market. In business, you should ensure that your competitors have access and resources that are used elsewhere. If they cannot find or contribute to your product or service, you can offer them a competitive edge. This can lead to competitive advantage both economically and creatively. In business, if you are seen as competitive, they may take your products or services for granted. If they do not like what you do or say, they may seek your punch again. This can lead to competitive advantage both economically and creatively."
that of the mind is in abysmal stillness. that of associations is in their being with the virtuous. that of words is in their trustworthiness,"When you are still, it is a sign of strength to stay. When you are connected, it means you can hold thoughts and feelings for long. And even when you are not connected, you still have a strong connection. 'Long' is a very serious word, one that many people use to mean much longer than a day. It can be very confusing and can make you feel inferior or even dead. The best way of communicating longer than this is to let your thoughts linger, although this is a good thing as you can let them linger even before you take action. 'Interactivity lasts forever' is a good way of saying this. Action lasts forever because you have a choice when you act or you have to wait for action. 'Long' can be confusing at times but it is important to understand it. 'Interactivity lasts forever' is a good way of saying this. Action lasts forever because you have a choice when you act or you have to wait for action. 'Long'"
that of government is in its securing good order. that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability,"To secure good order and discipline, we must know how to operate it best. If you know how to operate an army, well-armoured and well-equipped, then you will be able to attack and conquer with ease. It is therefore not enough simply to know how to operate an army. You must also know how to control the disorder that ensues. Knowing these is important in business as well as in politics."
and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness,"The 'timeliness' of a move is that it is rapid and steady, yet vulnerable to attacks from all sides. If a movement is slowed down in this way, it will be because of a weakness in communications or a dearth of skilled soldiers. If, however, a move is successful, it may be made again by way of a surprise attack. In both these ways it is a critical moment. Movement is about movement, not about timing. If you wait for the right moment, then the attack can be completed in time. This is the principle of the timing element."
"(Fulness and complacency contrary to the Dao)It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry it when it is full","Fulness and complacency is a dangerous thing. As with other conflicts, it can lead to you succumbing to the will of the enemy. If you let your fire go, your people will suffer and the fire will spread. It is better to let your fire go than to fight in it. Uncertainty also reduces ability to make decisions. It is better to let your decisions be made beforehand with the intent of victory. More generally, decisions made with certainty leads to more decisions being made."
