(Embodying the Dao)The Dao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Dao,"When you start out, it is not until you get to know the local people that you start to feel the effects of the previous day. When you travel further afield, it is important to do so in a way that you do so with a sense of control. In business, you can spend as much as you like in marketing and sales, but you must also be realistic and trust the advertising hoardings of a single leader. When you spend the resources of the marketing department, what you get is a product that seems simple but becomes complex as you go along. It is easy inactivity that causes alarm in the marketing department and weakens the boats of the customer service department. It is better to lash out at the weak arm of the individual sales person."
"The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. (Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth","When you think the possibilities, you may be surprised. When you do not know the model yet, you may be surprised. Then you may use that knowledge to your advantage. Of course you also have to take into account the possibility of the unknown, of the impossible, of the unknown, of other dimensions. This is why scouting reports are so important."
"(conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all things. Always without desire we must be found,If its deep mystery we would sound","The Mother of all things is here, right at the heart. When you step inside, the feel and act is like entering into a secret code. When you break the code, you open a previously undefended door. Your expectation of experience is like water being sucked into a chasm. It can be hard to get out and get it started. When you break the code, you open a previously undefended door. Your expectation of experience is like water being sucked into a chasm. It can be hard to get out and get it started. When you break the code, you open a previously undefended door. Your expectation of experience is like water being sucked into a chasm. It can be hard to get out and get it started. When you break the code, you open a previously undefended door. Your expectation of experience is like water being sucked into a chasm. It can be hard to get out and get it started. When you break the code,"
"But if desire always within us be,Its outer fringe is all that we shall see. Under these two aspects, it is really the same","When you expect a high performance from people, and they seek your approval, then they will strive to meet your expectations. In business, showing your confidence is a different story. See paragraph below for why you should seek your confirmation."
"but as development takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery","Deviation is a common and important problem. It is why so many people lose their jobs and keeps growllingters up. It is why so many children are abandoned and left with their lives. Yet many people make mistakes a day. It is not a quick fix. After all, you are not guaranteed a good life and many make mistakes a daily cost."
"(The nourishment of the person)All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is","The greatest gifts of wisdom are those that enable the foolish to make such mistakes as they are destined to make. In business, those who make foolish mistakes also make those who they think will win. If you want everyone to succeed, you must have the courage to make such mistakes. Yet if you also want everyone to succeed, then you must constantly reinvigorate and re-energize your brand."
"they all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the want of skill is","It is a dangerous thing to say that your whole group has no skill. It is dangerous to make such decisions for reasons of skill, not lack of readiness. Yet just because you have a talent, it does not mean you should demotivate them. In fact it is better to just keep them on your payroll and see what they do. The idea is that if you have the talent, then you can motivate and even motivate and even motivate and even motivate and even motivate and even motivate and even induce and even inspire and even inspire and even inspire and even inspire and even induce and even motivate and even confuse the enemy."
So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to (the idea of) the other,"Places have names, right? names that are left and right. You may be able to appear at certain places, but you will not be able to remove the appearance that has already been created. So, even if you appear to be well-disciplined and well-managed, you will still not be able to remove the fact that there is still much work to be done."
that difficulty and ease produce the one (the idea of) the other. that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other,"Being able to move quickly through thick and narrow ground is an advantage that can make you vulnerable to attackers. While you may not be able to move much in this way, you can still use the defensive tactics of motion to your advantage."
that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other,"When you are far away but wish to fight, them you must approach them over ground that may tire your troops and which may be hazardous and unfriendly, such that when you reach the enemy your troops are exhausted and in poor condition for a fight."
that the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another,"Communications is a complex and demanding business. Even today, even if your organization is split into two, you still have a significant advantage. Of course you also have risk. If you cannot take care of your own people, how can you depend on the people you serve? redundancy Do not assume that all responsibilities are equal. If you assume that all responsibilities are equal, then you can provide for your people and do the things you say you will do as ordered. If you do not know your responsibilities, you can stilltake advantage of them. In civilian life, people who do not understand their responsibilities are not expected to lead the most positive lives. They should be encouraged to succeed where others fail. The best way of doing this is to foster positive roles models and roles. If you are not a leader when you rule, then you should be a rule-breaker when you rule not. It is better to let people do the thinking behind the rules than to have them do the thinking for you."
and that being before and behind give the idea of one following another,'An army marches on it's stomach' is a common truism. Fresh troops are very quickly created. Your troops will likewise be fresh and ready for the next move.
"Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and conveys his instructions without the use of speech","So, what is the overall strategy? Well, it all depends on who you talk to. It can be summed up as 'using what you know to learn'. Knowing what you know is very similar to what you do not know, in that it gives you a fuller knowledge of the known situation. In business, what you do not know is that you do not always have all the answers. The same is true in business. You can learn what you know from other people, from your CIOs, from senior managers. What you should seek most of all is their certainty, insight and, above all, being honest. This is a key skill."
"All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show itself. they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership","When you know when and how something will happen, then you have time to bring more to the fore. It is always better to plan accordingly."
"they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a reward for the results)","If you do not know your own readiness, you will not be able to take advantage of such an opportunity. In business as in war, knowing when and how to act to greatest advantage is very important."
"The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in it (as an achievement). The work is done, but how no one can see","A whole army is no more strong than if it had not worked out how to attack. If, however, they had known how to defend, they would have known how to fight. And so they created the new state of play. Played out in a variety of ways, it seems that way is open to attack. Perhaps most important is the subtlety of their thinking about such things as honor and dishonor, and how to avoid and cope with such situations. In business, this principle is called 'Mitigating the enemy'. Honour is a complex and subjective principle. If you are not the enemy, then it is easier to avoid them. If you are, then it is better to let them know this. It is also better to let the enemy know that he or she is open to your attack. Even subtlety is suspect: if you are not their number-one concern, they will not know to what extent they are vulnerable. It is hence important to let them know of your plans"
(Keeping the people at rest)Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep the people from rivalry among themselves,"Compare and contrast your methods with those of a higher order, for example finding ways of making the enemy realize their strategic intent. If you find weaknesses in one method, ponder how you can improve it. If you can learn from it, what better way than by creating new methods and techniques that make it possible to create superior methods and tactics?"
not to prize articles which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves,"When you can grab something that can steal from other towns, you have a powerful deterrent force. When you grab something that can evade detection, you may also gain advantage by dropping some small items that are difficult to find. It is a useful combination when you both know that you can gain advantage by combining these two forces."
not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to keep their minds from disorder,"When you are all waiting on your own strength, keeping your eyes on the future, and having good communication, then a good many people will be able to see what is happening. If you not only give them what they want, you not only hinder their future plans, you also make it very difficult for them to see your traps. In business, when you are far away from the action, you may need to formulate them, allowing them to see your plans in a different way."
"Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones","It is a dangerous thing to think, especially about the down-trodden enemy. The realities of warfare, including deception and indirect attacks, can make any land unrefenable. With money, you can stay up all night chasing after the spoils of victory. With your back to a wall, you can attack a weaker force. If you can hear their noise, you may be able to find a replacement. If neither of these seems likely, you may be able to spend the summer hiding. In business, beware of throwing everything into campaigns if you do not know that you will win in this way. You can still win, however, if you stick together and took the weaker spots. If you capture objectives, you can then spend the remaining months trying to dislodge them. It is also possible you will fall in love and have them convert their fantasy into reality."
"He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them from presuming to act (on it)","Knowledge is power. The more knowledge that is, the greater the ability to do what is right for you. This requires that you keep this in mind. 1. You can't know everything. It takes skill to assemble the right group of people. 2. You can't all need to happen to be in the same place, yet many of the same people will be there (e.g.), yet many will be act brought to the fore. 3. You can't all need to happen to be in the same place, yet many of the same people will be there (e.g.), yet many will be act brought to the fore. Yates v. State, 5-6 (4th Cir. 1998).
You can't all need to happen to be in the same place, yet many of the same people will be there (e.g.), yet many will be act brought to the fore. 3. You can't all need to happen to be in the"
(The fountainless)The Dao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel. and in our employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness,"When you know your readiness, you will be more ready. Guerilla tactics are more dangerous if you are not on the move. If you are not ready, then the enemy may find you have lost your footing and use the attack of choice without a fight. If you are not ready, then they can gain further advantage by taking your belongings. When you are not using a force, you should not have defenses up front, so as to keep them constantly on the move. In this way, you can sustain pressure on their weak points, such as communication. If you are not strong enough, then then then then you may be able to hold these areas for a while, but then have to give up. When you are weaker, then you can still keep them at a distance, although with much stronger defense. Keep in mind that a state of disarray is a state of unreadyness. It does not help to be in a state of disarray when you have no other alternative. In"
"How deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things","Do not just go back to your own country. You should know at least a little bit of what has been done in the country you come to know and love. You can learn anything from how local people think to how they think about and act on your own time. You can then learn what has been done to improve relations between the army and the country you will be traveling to. This is the principle of the experienced warlike who works for the enemy. When you are away from home, you should know at least a little bit about the country you will be travelling to. You can then learn what has been done to improve relations between the army and the country you will be traveling to. This is the principle of the experienced warlike who works for the enemy. When you are away from home, you should know at least a little bit"
"We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of things","In war, intelligence is critical. This means your enemy will use all means, fair and foul, to learn of your plans. A secret shared is no longer a secret. Whilst some may be trusted, even the sharing may be overheard. The trusted person may also be captured and tortured for their knowledge. They may be blackmailed or bribed. The more critical the knowledge, the fewer should know. It is hence often better to keep major plans to oneself."
"we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into agreement with the obscurity of others","When you share a light, there is more to be gained than what is seen. There is also a shared common purpose. The best way to achieve this is to work together. For example when you can just about see anything, why not follow your own example and look for the greater goal? This is the principle of the feint, where a false attack triggers a defensive move that also exposes a weakness. In business, you can make small competitive moves just to see how your competitors react. You can then plan a more effective campaign."
(The use of emptiness)Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent,"When you are above all things, the feeling of awe is a result of the feeling of control and direction. When you are below all things, the effect is to cause the body to use up its energy, leading to loss of control and potentially death. The same feeling may be felt by those who are above all others, for example when they are overwhelmed by the demand for their services. The same feeling may be felt by people who are slightly above you, for example when they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of customers and suppliers they have to respond to a regular basis."
they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent,"Move when there is advantage to be gained and where this outweighs the ever-present risk of moving. The underlying principle is to constantly understand advantage and disadvantage, and to keep acquiring information that will give you the knowledge as to how to make this decision."
they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with. May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows,"War is fought on the surface of the earth, which has attributes such as height, hardness, distance and so on. Factor geographic factors into your planning. Even and especially with the global economy, geography is an important business variable. Transport costs. Being near your customers helps you be more responsive. And so on. We think in three-dimensional metaphors which can also be useful. We talk about taking the high ground, being in trouble, getting over things and so on. Understand how 3D thinking helps and hinders you."
"'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power. 'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more. Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see","'Tis possible to be moved by a powerful being, but if you do not know where you are at any moment, you must be ready now. Hence the need for vigilance and practice even before you reach the conclusion that your defenses are complete. In this way, you can hold off a larger force who has already attacked you. This is 'the axiom of defense to retreat is essential'."
"(The completion of material forms)The valley spirit dies not, aye the same. The female mystery thus do we name","The spirit of discovery is most felt when there are not much else to do. The same happens with art and science. The same is true of business. Whilst you may be able to use some downtime to recover from them, you will still need to use a smaller number of people. This is not a good time to try to engineer change. "
"Its gate, from which at first they issued forth,Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth","The world is made up of opposing pairs, physically and mentally. Seeing and understanding these is a part of the genius of the individual, and so must be carefully considered. In business, there are many 'roads', measures and techniques that can be taken to help you succeed. These are described in more detail in the paragraphs below."
(Sheathing the light)Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long,"Light chariots are difficult to drive and are difficult to keep. Burning up their ranks can be disastrously expensive. Burning the army down is easy when the land is overgrown with weeds and undergrowth that sustains and rewards evil. Burning the country out of them is difficult when you have no alternative but to fight or be killed. In war, a small group can be very powerful. The above scenarios suggest ways to manage this or that capability."
"The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves","life. On Earth, happiness is measured in terms of years of continuous existence. In comparison, the emotional well-being of your people is measured in kilometres per hour. This means each person represents a kilometre away. Factors such as climate, number of people, the presence or absence of threats and other factors can have a critical effect on a decision. The same is true in business. Spirited leaders can make decisions with only a few exceptions. Hence, if you are surprised by a sudden change in business or if you have seen the CEO you need to make such a change now."
"This is how they are able to continue and endure. Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in the foremost place","The being of perfect individualism, as with all good managers, is to seek the highest heights, most actively manage the people and avoid mistakes. The same is true of business. Those who make mistakes then go to great expenditure to repeat the mistake."
"he treats his person as if it were foreign to him, and yet that person is preserved","Treating your opponent as if you had lost touch leads to losing all the time. You should seek the opposite approach. Recognizing your own good soldiers is a part of the job, although it may also mean coming to the rescue rather than fighting. The same is true of your enemy. Understanding their mentality can in turn help you in this important department."
(The placid and contented nature)The highest excellence is like (that of) water,"It is not about the slope, but rather about turning the dew-proofing iron. The same thrust will do, but turning wood or stone will not. The same principle will work in business. Maturity techniques will be important here. For help with this, read about how to succeed in business."
"The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike","Water is a fluid that has many moving parts. It is a good fluid for rolling stones, rolling wood, rolling metal, rolling fluids, and many more. It also has a number of stabilizing qualities, such as being stable and having no break or interruption. When tension is high, then any number of volatile reactions can be expected. When tension is low, then any number of simple but powerful moves can be expected. All this being said, if you are ready for action and the wind, then you may be able to outmanoeuvre the enemy."
Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Dao. The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place,"When you have a large army, it is important that the best forces are used together. In particular when you have a large army, it is important that you are able to use many of the resources you have. In business, if you can assemble a budget for a specific campaign, you can ensure that the budgets for all other departments are in keeping with this goal."
that of the mind is in abysmal stillness. that of associations is in their being with the virtuous. that of words is in their trustworthiness,"Sleep is a precious resource. While you may not be able to get enough, you will still be suffering through the day."
that of government is in its securing good order. that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability,"War is a game of positioning. Where you are at any time is critical. In between, as you travel to these places, you are vulnerable. Speed hence reduces the chance of dangerous attack. Getting to strong positions earlier than the enemy expects also gives you the advantage of surprise and hence letting you attack them where they are weak. Speed also lets you travel in circuitous routes to avoid detection and yet arrive in time. Finally, speed gives the general who prepared well that final command. He is the one who knows when to fight to succeed. For this reason, the importance of positioning in wars is repeated many times throughout the whole army. It is important to remember that the rules are similar for business and in business espionage. Spies are usually sent to gather information for the company"
and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness,"In planning maneuvers, it is important not only for the readiness of the army, but also for the important moments in which the move is likely to succeed. Timing of the movement, as always, should coincide with the moment of greatest advantage. Timing can be critical in battles, where timing is critical. In business, when you know when and where they will be doing the business for you, then you can make better decisions."
"(Fulness and complacency contrary to the Dao)It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry it when it is full","Fulness and complacency are two different things. Empty spies and motivated ones work together only if they are motivated. Those who think they can achieve great things only if they are motivated, blinded by the same ambition, always ready to engage in indirect and calculated attacks. These are the kinds of people who can inspire the next generation of warriors. Disciplined and positive warriors are what can win the war between the warrior and the individual. When people are motivated, they will fight for you even when they are outnumbered. This is the spirit and motivation of our warrior."
