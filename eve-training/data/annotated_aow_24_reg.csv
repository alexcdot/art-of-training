Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.,"A modern army has evolved to fight in a variety of situations. Whilst there is room for improvement, there is always room for improvement. The ability to adapt and find ways to improve is a powerful tool for today's teams. In particular, if you can use your skill set to find and respond to multiple threats, then you have a significant advantage."
"It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.",Compare life and death with the thing you love most. Do not let hatred of life prevent affection for the fallen. Love your dead and be prepared to take on the living. Do not let shame prevent courage. Trust in your officers and men. Do not take risks. Be an agent of change. Always remember the greater good. Respect elders and their decisions. Respect the rule of law. Respect the laws and conduct yourself in a spirit of trust and integrity. Be honest in your dealings with all parties. Respect your individual soldiers. Be fair and just. Respect the natural state of your people. Respect international law. Respect your homeland. Respect your people. Respect your soil. Respect their dependents. Respect their commands. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline. Respect their discipline.
"The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.","War is fought for the sole purpose of winning. If you want to win, you have to win. Winning is also a means by which you can gain more wars and more resources than you need. Perhaps the single most important skill is in the management of armies, where planning, discipline and other performance management skills are highly outdated. In business, managers often have little to no science or business training. They are just computer models designed to help their people do the most powerful and successful things at all levels. Hence the need for many courses. In business, you can learn a great deal by simply doing business. Businesses may be more successful if you learn a great deal from business. Then you can make better money."

"The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.",'The Moral Law' is a simple yet powerful principle. If you understand it then you can also design and implement many other principles.
"Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.","If you want to know the seasons, go to the Heavens. If you want to know the seasons, go to the Earth. If you want to know the elements, go to the Sun. If you want to know the laws of physics, go to the Earth. If you want to know the laws of chemistry, go to the Moon. If you want to know the laws of physics, go to the Stars. If you want to know the laws of physics, go to the Stars. If you want to know the laws of other space, go to the opposite of the Heavens. If you want to know the laws of other dimensions, go to the Earth. If you want to know the laws of gravity, go to the Earth. If you want to know the laws of gravity, go to the Sun. If you want to know the laws of all-or-nothing, go to the Heavens. If you want to know all-or-nothing, go to the"
"Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.","You can't travel on solid ground unless you have at least some distance between you and the nearest available point. You can travel on open ground only if you can see enough to go around. A good place to start with a strait is where you can comfortably lie for a few days. Passions can be aroused by such places. Strong ground above gives attractive passes and bulges between provides routes for enemies who cannot get to them. Pushing through weakens your hold, allowing you to march on the next pass."
"The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.","This is not a 'wise' thing to do. The same is true for 'relaxed and steady eyes'. Calm and steady eyes are important in war, where the enemy is constantly on the move. Steadiness and calm are important in business, where competitors are constantly on the move. In business, high morale and high morale are good things. But in war, high morale and low morale are bad things. Beware of going into battle with a low morale and high morale, even if those are good things. When fighting, be sure of taking as many of your men as you possibly can. In business, always have something you need to know. Wherever you are, have people with you. Ensure your people are well-fed and that their needs are met. Ensure that your people have access to all the tools and knowledge they need to succeed in all their competitive activities. This is what enables you to grow and thrive."
"By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.","'Marshaling' is 'the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army'. Discipline is a 'modifying power'. The principle is the same as in business: try to control what is changing in your organization, not just what is said and done. Discipline is good for executives, for showing that they are fair and equitable and not just for the customers. The same principle applies to business).'Deception' is a critical skill that can be learnt from good leaders. Deception can be used well in business too, where bad communication can lead to squandered opportunities and lead to waste of time and money. Beware of managers who can't keep to their word and who can deceive, as they can lose their way and fail on critical campaigning."
These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.,"There are five basic types of generalship, or 'comprehensive wisdom'. These five types of leadership are appropriate for each situation. Note that these types of leadership are not the same thing as 'general competence'. Competence is taking responsibilities, not being able to lead. To succeed, you must be able to take the responsibilities into your own hands. If you can ensure that your people are clearly competent and that you have good strategy and military acumen, then you will be able to take risks and win. Competence is caring, believing that others will take your place and that you will lead. Competence is caring, believing your people will follow you, and believing they will care for you. This is a general's way of caring."
"Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--","Take time to think, to think the possibilities. Be open to possibilities. Do not hold back in thinking. To take time to think is to take time to think. Concentrate your thoughts and energies. Do not let too much go out of your hands. Pretend to be wrong. Seek the unknown. Understand the unknown. What you put into the unknown, what you make available to the unknown, may yet be true. In business, this is called 'expectation building'. When you make decisions based on the 'expectation building' method, you are not anticipating the likely outcomes you may achieve. In business, your future may look bright, but you may still miss important opportunities. These are important things to keep in mind."
(1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? (2) Which of the two generals has most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?,"When it comes to planning and preparation, always consider the future. If you can predict the future, how you and your troops will act in it, and how you and your strategies will carry it forward, then you have a strong chance of winning the war. But if you cannot foresee or foresee the future, then you should seek the advice of experienced war strategists."
By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.,"When you need to defend a strong position, you need all the troops around you. With a weak force, you have to move far to gain access. With a large force, you have to respond. With few, you have to hold off a larger force. The list goes on. It is a good exercise to understand the different factors that affect success. In particular where factors such as weather or geography make a difference, such as in the battle for the weak points, see section 'Nine Factors'.) Although the list is long and may be confusing, it is a starting point for understanding the different factors that affect success and failures. Success comes from people taking risks with little regard for the consequences. Success comes from people taking risks with the ability to make the most of failures and the natural tendency of others to take risks for you (the DoT).) Success comes from people who will take risks and not from the DoT (the 'DoT' being 'Do Not Use' and"
"The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!","When you know that the enemy will use all means available, you have a better chance of defeating them than if you had waited until you knew the enemy were weaker. The same is true for luck. Do not let your chance of defeating the superior force of chance exceed your chance of defeating the weaker force. The same is true for chess. Always consider the other team's performance against you, not your own. If they are stronger, better to lose. If they are weaker, better to win. If you can win, you have greater advantage over them."
"While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.","Here are five things that should never be done. These are not necessary, but are important if you are going to build a strong business."
"According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.","It is not always easy being a leader. It takes courage to take risks and it takes dedication to do the impossible. It takes commitment to work hard every day to achieve great things. But it is always better to have the courage to take risks and the determination to do the impossible. For example in war, when you are outnumbered and outplayed, you are less likely to succeed than when you are in a position of superior strength. In business, when you are outnumbered and outplayed, you are less likely to succeed. Such are the challenges facing leaders."
All warfare is based on deception.,"Deceit is a common and critical tactic. It is hence likely to be used by both sides. In business, deception is common and expensive ground. When both sides are deceitful and costly, it can be hazardous for the competitor."
"Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","You can attack in any direction, any time, making for a tense situation that keeps both of you vulnerable. You can use all your strength to crush an army, turning them into impotent machines. You can turn and turn and attack, only to be stopped by a last-ditch effort from the other side."
"Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.","Disorder is when a vast force of people marches in a circle and is confronted by a large, drawn-out force. When the circle is round and the army is all, then the officers and men of each side are in total disorder. If the disorder is under control, then the generals and heads of business will rush in to take the lead. If the disorder is under control, then the people will step forward and demand an end to the disorder and others will follow. The general who takes the lead will be beloved and rewarded. The leader who takes the disorder lead will be harshly punished. In business, the managers may have a hard time finding the right people and may be forced to make poor hires. If you can get their attention, they may seek your replacement. In business, when the top brass is busy, people will flock to their own ranks. This changes the dynamics of the competing companies. When people are being fired or demoted, they are most likely motivated by greed and"
"If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.","A strong defense is one that can hold a fight for an overwhelming majority of the time. Do not let a weaker army take the first step. Even if you are outnumbered, you should still use your advantage of superior strength to take the first step. Be smart about this and make sure you provide a sufficient force for the right move. If you can hold out for long enough, then the natural advantage of the opposing force will wane. If you can use this advantage to your advantage, then you can win. War is fought on the land, not on the computer screens that tell you when to strike. If you cannot defend at all, you are going to have to find a way around the computer. It takes resources all to defend a very large army. It takes skill to defend a small one. It takes cunning and courage to stand a serious chance in a computer game. Even a small chance of a win for the army can have huge cost. At the very top you will find armies"
"If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.","When you are weak and vulnerable and cannot win, you may find you can win by provoking his temper."
"If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.",Rest is a great feeling. Unity means sharing in the good will of the people. Unity means not dividing. Unity means sharing your spirit. Seeing and understanding adds meaning and purpose to conflicts. Seeing and understanding also keeps allies onside and helps maintain order.
"Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","In a place of high defense, you should prepare in advance. You may be attacked in advance by a smaller force, for example where your troops are pinned down by a more experienced officer. Attack where it is safe to do so. In the heat of ambition, it is often better to stay where you are than to go to fight. The same principle applies in business: where competitors may be motivated to find ways to outplay them, they may seek to take your jobs. A good place to start out is where you have a reputation as being fair and accessible. When competitors see you have great potential, they may be more suspicious."
"These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.","Deception is a dangerous thing. Lots of it. Learn to avoid it and you can win. Knowing the other side's intent, and the intent of your own people before divulging it, can lead to victory. Knowing their intent is also important. Do not let their intent be suspect. Be their judge. And so on. It is a good thing you do it this way. Knowing the other side is a good thing too. Knowing their intent can give you a very good lead. Knowing their communications is a good thing too. Knowing their plans is a bad thing too. Knowing their forces is a bad thing too. Finally, of course, you must consider the other side as you see fit. Do you wish them well?</|endoftext|>
