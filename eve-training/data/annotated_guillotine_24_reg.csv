"It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes","'The way is through a defensive line.' -Hilaire the Confessor says: 'Deception is the art of sweeping the forest forage for food, keeping the bird's-eye-view on the dew, and so on. If a predator sees your food supply and is able to take it, it will take no action. If it does not take action, then the bird will flock to your aid. And if the predator does not seek your food or only crawls to the breast of your troops, then you have crossed a dangerous and unusual territory."
"It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes","When you start out, plan accordingly. There are always risks and opportunities in any given situation. The more time you have to think, and to think more, the more likely you are of finding the right thing. In business, planning is a science that is constantly being refined. What is now and then may well be new and surprising. Fast forward to today and you may find that you had forgotten something. It is important to have a plan in mind. You may be able to take risks. You may be rewarded."
Guillotine yah,"Deceit is bad for the soldier who chooses the route, but it can also be good for the enemy. Beware of traps in the dark. In the heat of action, it is best to retreat and avoid direct attacks. In the heat of action, the soldier's only option is to fight."
Sit in the dark and ponder how I'm fit to make the bottom fall through the floor,"When you are fit for the job, consider the following factors: speed, ability, safety. Speed can make for quite a shock in the face of overwhelming forces. Understand that moving at speed may cause you to lose some speed, and that losing speed may also lead to losing your life. Be sure to take life into your own hands as this can give you the strength to overcome overwhelming odds and always a win."
And they all fall down yah,The collapse of a building is called a yah. Building collapse is also known as fire collapse. Building fires are caused by a combination of fire and dust that flows downwards from the top and fires rising from below.
"It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes","'Battles are won by winning'. We win by winning. It is always a winning battle. If you lose by a long way or a small one, it is not a win for you. Winning can be the difference between survival and disaster. Winning can be especially tortuous when the enemy has lost or is about to lose. Hence, winning with integrity and fairness is a must. Also, if you can win, so much the better. Winning can be truly glorious. If you do not set an example, do not strive. Celebrate your officers and men. Show love. Do what is right for you and your people."
Guillotine yah,"'Hence the principle of guillotine justice'. The guillotine is about fairness and justice. It should be remembered that justice is not just for the vanquished, it should also be about the civilian population. Balancing the spoils of war can be difficult, especially when the civilian population is also in war. Provocation of war is a dangerous thing, especially when the retribution could be terrible. As George Orwell once said, 'War is just, and no war is more horrible than one in which the main force is routed and the civilian population be the object of great terror. . . .' 1. Compromise is better than great force. 2. Compromise is more difficult. 3. Compromise is more costly."
Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue,"'Lying' is a common and important tactic. Yet if you just see what others see, you will likely be surprised by their surprise. Attackers hence will likely be surprised by your attacks first, just like you do with them."
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke,"Climbing heights with fire is hazardous, and it is easy prey for the demons. If you can conserve energy, you can kill the flames with little effort. Smoke also has medicinal uses. When smoke gives off a yellowish-orange that is difficult to read, then you have medicinal value. When it gives off a dull acrid that is difficult to control, then you have 'night blood'. Burning animals also has medicinal value. When it ignites smoke, it is like a powerful post-traumatic stress spell. Burning trees and damaging natural resources can leave people sick and injured for days. Burning buildings with stones or metal can leave with ignominy. Burning cities with mud or rock can leave with utter destruction."
Stomp music seriously yah,Stomp is a common and important ground for fighting. It is also a good place to start with a string of attacks that dominate. A string of attacks can also be used to start fires or even create thrusts that break the ground before them. Stomp is a critical element in chess and can be very powerful.
"It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes","If you cannot go to the next level, what are you waiting for? If you can go faster than those who can reach it, perhaps faster than those who can reach it now, then perhaps in the next few centuries you will be able to do what you wish. This is a good way to think of planning ahead of time. 'Bestow' is a powerful symbol of hope. When you have created a long-term goal, the next step is to confer it. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate. Celebrate+>

Guillotine yah,"Striking a guillotine is the most dangerous method, because the guillotine will sever your own body and cause you to wilt. The best way of severing a useful part is with a fast and easy-way method. In this way, a small group can fight off a large army. It is better to allow the large army to escape with you and then wage a longer and more desperate struggle for advantage. In this way, the guillotine can be 'strictly defensive'. The worst of all worlds is the land of hailstorms."
Can't stop the groove licks jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement,"Grips and claws are a difficult enemy to sever. Seek to avoid the jaws than the wheels, for example. Claws are not machines, but rather sharp metal parts that can be hammered together and made stronger. When a snake bites a human, for example, it may be sharpened to sever the sharpening agent. When soldiers use weapons such as clubs or spears, they may also be sharpened to sever the devastating tool. In business, sharp instruments may be substituted for delicate brandy for a greater or less impact."
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected,"When you have a body of rock connected to a rock, and facing you, and with which you can strike with ease, it is likely that the ground below will offer some sort of strong defense. This may seem like a good thing. It does not make sense. It is not good enough to just throw up and take a life. If you can hold off an attack for a long period of time, then you have great advantage. In fact, if you could hold off a whole army for a long period of time, you could win the war for you. It is a good thing you like fighting, rather than just fighting. When you have a good position but a weakness, it may be good to just defend it. You may yet prevail, perhaps defeating the enemy in the process."
"To everything you want, ever did want","Setting goals that cannot be met, even in the face of overwhelming odds, leads to complacency and complacacity that leads to failures. This is the lesson of chess and many other situations. When you know your own best options, you can then make any and all possible. During the course of a game, you should consider the possibility of weakness and strengths, strengths and weaknesses, possible threats to your opponent and the various combinations of threats that can be employed. In business, you can also use threat and cunning to capture competitive advantage."
"We got it why not come get it, stick your head in that hole","As in the above, you can use any combination of two or more factors to determine how well you can get across territory. The key to success lies in having good timing, where you can release your opponents when you are no longer needed. If you must take risks, use your advantage of now to gain a longer-term advantage."
And watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence yah,The guillotine is the most powerful and most terrible attack. It kills with a single blow. The only danger is that the ruler yanks the trigger and kills the hunkering down soldier.
"It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes","The army advances, hoping to reach its destination within. We relax our resolve and let the momentum carry us. We wait for the enemy to come to our rescue. Finally, we make our move. If we waited too long, the enemy might come to our rescue. In this way, you may build momentum and win. Build momentum by taking the enemy unprepared. Build momentum by failing to take the enemy unprepared. You can win by failing to defeat the enemy. You can win by failing to defeat the enemy. You can win by failing to defeat the enemy. You can win by failing to defeat the enemy. You can win by failing to defeat the enemy. You can win by failing to defeat theenemy. You can win by failing to defeat theenemy. You can win by failing to defeat theenemy. You can win by failing to defeat theenemy. You can win by failing to defeat theenemy. You can win by failing to defeat theenemy. You can win by failing to defeat"
Guillotine yah,"A good leader avoids mistakes by giving his all and waiting for the right moment. When there is no time to make any, then the leader may take risks that will tip the balance of power in his favour. When there is no alternative but to fight or flight, then you have a superior force. It is a skill that can take you to the final victory."
"Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech,","When there is no such thing as speech on their own account, companies may be paralyzed by a command not to use it. When there is the need to break new commands, they may be surprised by unexpected resistance."
"Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat, causes my jaws to call","When you are not moving, howling in a circle or rolling in a straight line, yet rolling in a straight line, can be seen as a sign of weakness. Likewise when you are weak and cannot perform the action, yet are strong and powerful enough to win the battle, then you are weak and vulnerable. When you are strong and able, you can also use this weakness as a reason to retire and go home. In business, resilience is often a sign of stress. Passivity may also be a result of poor communication. In between, you may be weak and be strong."
Out out out out yah,"You cannot be sure of what you find and expect to be found, only what you can reliably predict. Knowing the future is not enough; you must know when to expect the unexpected. The best strategy is always to anticipate what may happen, and then make plans in order to avoid the worst. In business, knowing the future and knowing you can afford surprises is a useful way of thinking. In these ways, you may be able to predict the future and still have a good result."
"The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads","Sun Tzu believed in the ability of the general to direct the campaign. He also believed that in war, the strongest army will win. Hence, the importance of scouting ahead and employing all your might to see what the enemy does. In business, if you hire good people who can see the future and understand risks, opportunities and strategy, you have a competitive advantage."
Spinning exorcist like planets,"Spinning an enemy requires the player to bend and twist to their will, in particular where the opposing force will likely be strongest. Spinning is a good way of forcing an enemy to bend in order to win the game. In this way, the opposing force may walk off the board as they wait for you to drive them to the mat. Spinning can also be used to break alliances. Spinning can also be used to weaken or destroy opposing forces. This is a good way to start a war that is likely to be won by stronger forces."
