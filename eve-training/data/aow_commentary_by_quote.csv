Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.,"War is not just for the military commanders. It is a tool for the state to achieve important goals such as defending the country and influencing others. In business, competition is not just for the marketing department. The organization's leaders should be deeply engaged in it. Many leaders get bound up in operational tactics, forgetting that they should be focusing more on strategy."
"It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.","War will happen, with you or without you. If you are not strong and wily then others will overrun you. If you wage war unwisely, you will only weaken yourself. In business, focusing on customers is not enough. Sounding aggressive is also not enough. Spending wildly on advertising campaigns or otherwise blithely attacking others may also lead to ruin. War and competition needs intelligent and constant attention."
"The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.","Here are five things to think about. Maybe not everything, but a very useful set."
These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.,. . . and here they are (with descriptions below).
"The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.","When a ruler acts in a moral way, showing fairness in all dealings and caring for the subjects, then the subjects willreciprocate, caring in return even to the point of death. Love begets love. Moral law is also related to harmony and ensuring alignment in all things. In business, a perform-or-perish, hire-and-fire attitude may seem good for business but does not lead to loyal employees. If you clearly care about your people they will care about you and care about the business. Leadership begets followership."
"Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.","The world is made up of opposing pairs, yin and yang. Seeing and understanding these can give you advantage, for example understanding the real impact of high and low ground, or fighting in summer or winter. This is embedded in the contrast principle. Heaven is the opposite of the hard earth, indicating light, rain, temperature and so on. In business, when you are doing well, know that doing badly is never far away. If you have enemies then you may also have friends. Do not be trapped by single-track thinking."
"Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.","War is fought on the surface of the earth, which has attributes such as height, hardness, distance and so on. Factor geographic factors into your planning. Even and especially with the global economy, geography is an important business variable. Transport costs. Being near your customers helps you be more responsive. And so on. We think in three-dimensional metaphors which can also be useful. We talk about taking the high ground, being in trouble, getting over things and so on. Understand how 3D thinking helps and hinders you."
"The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.","As with the Moral Law, how you lead dictates whether and how people follow. And how you lead depends on who you are, inside. Yourbeliefs,values,models and so on is how you win and lose wars. Wisdom is knowing the right thing to do. Sincerity is believing in what you do. Benevolence is helping those you could harm. Courage is overcoming personal fears. Strictness is ensuring others do as they should. These may be combined as integrity. Leaders with integrity create passionate, dedicated followers. If you are in business, can you say these are true of you? If you would manage others or lead the charge, consider how you can develop these qualities."
"By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.","When you have a vast swathe of troops, it is important that each knows where they should be and what they should do. Strict hierarchical organization is a powerful way of achieving this. An army travels far, and roads are important both for rapid movement and steady supplies. Wars are won by far more than fighting. In business, sloppy organization is often mistaken as a way of motivating people. Clear roles and goals works wherever you are. Armies and businesses spend money and both can run out if it is not managed carefully. Whatever your raison d'etre, cash is still key."
These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.,Armies and businesses thrive and die based on what leaders truly understand or misunderstand.
"Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--","Take time to understand what you understand, and especially what the leaders understand and how they will think and act based on this understanding."
(1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? (2) Which of the two generals has most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?,"This uses theFive Constant Factors to compare both yourself and your opponents against the same standard. If one of you has a better understanding of these, then this will confer a huge understanding. If one has a weakness in just one area, then this is where attack will be most successful. (1)Values and morals start from the very top and filter down. What the leader does, others will copy. (2) War is not won by fine words and dress, but by cunning and command. The true ability of generals will only be found out in practice. (3) Understanding of opposites and geography can be usefully compared. Beware of enemies who have strength in either. (4) Discipline is at the root of all action. Even with the finest strategy, an ill-disciplined force will fail. Build and sustain discipline from day one. (5) When two armies are pitted against one another on equal terrain, the strongest will win. If you are weaker, avoid a direct fight. If you are stronger, seek it. (6) Discipline comes out of training. So also does cunning and knowledge of strategy and tactics. If your enemy's forces are learning faster than yours, you are in trouble. (7) Discipline is only effective if it isconsistently applied. Values of the leaders are only transmitted if they are consistently displayed. Troops are clearlymotivated when they know that night follows day and consequences follow action."
By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.,"In our attempts to understand the complexity of the world around us, we tend to simplify. This is both natural and potentially very dangerous. Although this is a simple model, it takes a deeper understanding of the many sub-factors to make such forecasts. It is always a good exercise to use such models to compare both yourself and the other side against such models. Although this will not tell you everything, it can tell you much, especially where you have a weakness. Always remember that the other side may also have read Sun Tzu and be applying his advice."
"The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!","Read, understand and apply Sun Tzu. Do not reject it because it seems too simple, too complex or too outdated. If you think this, question your own understanding."
"While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.","And even Sun Tzu is not everything. Seek, study and listen elsewhere. Believe nobody has absolute knowledge yet many can contribute. Look for those who can contribute most for you, where you are, now."
"According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.",'Favorable circumstances' are those where the situation suits particular strategies and tactics. Do not blindly follow advice. Understand how the jigsaw works and place the pieces where they fit.
All warfare is based on deception.,"Deception appears at all levels, from faked strategic intent to the feints and dodges of swordplay. Much business is also deception, particularly in terms of deceiving competitors. Beware, however, about deceiving customers or employees who may turn against you when they discover this betrayal."
"Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.","As humans, we are naturally deceptive. Evolution has made us so. It has also made us cautious and good at detecting deception. The side which both spots deception and deceives the best, wins. Consider every perception of the other side and find ways of changing this."
"Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.","These are but two examples, and yet each deserves attention. When an opponent is greedy for conquest they will grab unthinking at what seems like an easy gain, especially if it seems that the opportunity is brief. When it seems that you are disorganized or otherwise vulnerable, even for a moment, they may seek to take quick advantage of your temporary disarray. In such ways traps can be laid for the unsuspecting enemy who gifts you a win. Yet always beware the double-bluff where then enemy sees your deceptions and counters your trick with a better one, leading your arrogant response into a deeper trap."
"If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.","When you can find no way through a strong defense, Deception is perhaps most important when you are weak and cannot depend on strength. This is the strategy of prey who use camouflage and other ways of deceiving the predator."
"If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.","A choleric temper is one which is easily roused. When we are emotionally roused, we think far less and so are open to simple traps. Those who easily become angry often do this as a way of feelingpowerful, yet they may have learned that this is not a guarantee of success. The bully only attacks the weakling. If you appear weak, caution is not needed and the bully will more easily emerge."
"If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.","Everyone needs rest. Even being alert and ready to defend is draining, let alone the exhaustion that battle engenders. One way to weaken your enemy is hence to constantly harry and pick at them. Random small attacks createsuncertainty and keeps them tense. In this way, a small and nimble army can defeat a much larger army. Guerilla war is one such method. Concentrated forces are very difficult to defeat as front-line troops can quickly be replaced with reinforcements. If you can break them into parts or spread them out along a long front, removing the ability to reinforce, then a single, small victory can provide you with a powerful gain. In this way,divide-and-conquer is a common and powerful strategy."
"Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.","Do not attack in force where the enemy is strongest, although keeping stronger forces can be helpful while you throw a fierce attack at weak corners elsewhere. As with other suggestions, Sun Tzu makes use ofsurprise to keep the enemy in a state of confusion and uncertainty."
"These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.","Deception only works when the other side does not realize that it is so. Hence great secrecy is needed, and perhaps even deception about the deception."
"Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.","Battles are won or lost before they are started. There is much in the way of planning and preparation that is required. If you are prepared for the many possible actions of the enemy and the fickle hands of fate, then you may take advantage of opportunity and avoid the horrible surprise of being outplayed by the leader on the other side. In planning, knowledge of the other side is critical. Knowing their strength, their position and intent helps you make better calculations, although you must always be ready for surprise. Of course the main plan never survives the battle. When the enemy acts, you have to respond. Yet even plans that are never implemented have their value in readying you. As Eisenhower said, 'Plans are nothing, but planning is everything. 'In business, managers often make plans as if the future is pre-ordained to happen as they believe it should. If they do not consider alternative scenarios they may be surprised. If they do not build resilience and readiness, they may be defeated by more agile competitors."
"Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.","War is expensive in many ways. It costs many lives. It can ruin international relationships. It can break reputations at home. But in the heat of ambition or retribution, what must always be remembered is the unromantic fact that war costs money. Lots of it. You may be able to borrow money or use resources you always have, but you will still have to pay for the war. Many countries have been economically ruined by a bellicose ruler. It is a wise leader who chooses battles carefully. The same is true of business. Competing can cost you much more than producing your product or delivering your service. Choose your fights carefully and always consider the cost before deciding to fight."
"When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.","War should be short and sharp for several reasons, an important one being that soldiers are not machines. War is won with troops who are fired up and ready for battle. Prolonged campaigns simply wear them out. This is one reason why siege is a poor strategy that should be avoided if at all possible. In business, your people likewise can only work at high levels for short bursts and need their breaks and holidays to refresh and reinvigorate."
"Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.","War also costs. When a country goes to war it is not just the soldiers who are affected. They have families who fret whilst they must be put to work to support the war effort. And the state's coffers may be depleted of money as the endless cost of weapons, logistics, wages and so on continues to mount. In business, competitive campaigns can likewise be costly. It is one thing to say 'we will fight' and it is another to stump up, day after day, for endless warring."
"Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.","When troops are exhausted and weapons used up, and supporting resources gone you are in a position of great weakness and may be easily defeated. Such situations should be seen long before they happen and in time to be actively avoided. In reverse, if you can catch your enemy at a low point, you may snatch victory at relatively little cost. It is one of the strategies of defense to hunker down and let the enemy deplete their resources before springing out to take advantage of their exhaustion. In business, beware of throwing everything into campaigns if you do not know that you will win in this way. Steadiness often beats exuberance."
"Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.","'More haste, less speed' is a common saying. Yet delay also has its costs. You need time to think and prepare, but you must also be aware that delay has costs as your resources are being spent whatever you do. In business as in war, if you delay you give space for your opponents to take the initiative. Whilst planning and preparation is important, action is where value is finally created."
There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.,"Prolonged battle, even if it finally exhausts the enemy, is not a smart way to fight. A war of attrition is simply expensive and its costs will be felt long after the fighting has finished. A smarter way is use cunning and strategy that give a quick win."
It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.,"It is possible to profit from war, for example by plundering as you go, although this can still have a cost in the guerilla and other subtle revenges. Evil generally means taking pleasure in harming others. Evil people do find their way into armies as this provides a means to their ends. Beware those who fight for their own pleasure rather than for the love of their country and colleagues. In business predators can be found who buy up ailing companies in order to greedily strip their assets without care for the people they throw out onto the streets. This is bad for business, which is its own brand."
"The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.","Taxes at home to pay for wars are not popular and not good for morale. It is better to find other ways. Also, once war is declared, a strong army does not wait for reinforcements or supplies but uses surprise to quickly invade, creating momentum and gaining immediate ground. In business, once you have secured a budget for marketing and sales, you should use that or find funds elsewhere, rather than going back, cap in hand."
"Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.","It is always better to use your own weapons which you know well. For food and other supplies, it can be very helpful if you can capture these from your enemy. In business, this could translate into such as winning getting government funding and support away from competitors."
Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished.,"If the state does not have money to sustain the army, they must find funds from people in the country via various levies and donations. This is not a good way to fight the war as it weakens the morale and capability of the home population."
"On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.","If the army has to buy provisions from other countries, then the additional demand on limited resource will make the price go up. Merchants may also take advantage of an army who has no other alternative. When the army buys provisions and when prices go up, those who would normally buy those same provisions may find they cannot afford the new prices and so start to dislike the army that they might once have admired."
"When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.",Exaction is 'an act of demanding or levying by force or authority'. Those with little often suffer most in wartime.
"With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total revenue.","Here is an estimation tool for what may be the unseen cost of warfare in the time of Sun Tzu. What is it now for you? Understand the wider costs, quantifying these where possible."
"Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's own store.",It is better to take the food destined for the enemy's troops than the food from the people in the lands you pass through or have to sustain long supply lines. This not only helps non-combatants but it also weakens the enemy. The motivational effects of this are significant. (One picul is equal to 133. 3 pounds or 65. 5 kilograms).
"Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.","Anger has a biochemical effect on the body and the brain. Fear is forgotten. Adrenaline courses through the muscles. The natural state for fighting is aroused. A simmering anger also is effective in motivating troops over the longer term. In this way the atrocities of the enemy may be held up and amplified such that they create a longer-term hatred that drive the army on and on until victory is gained. The desire forjustice is a result of a feeling ofbetrayal or that sacredvalues have been transgressed. When victory is the means of restoration, then soldiers will single-mindedly seek the defeat of their bitter enemies."
"Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.","Position the spoils of war as just reward for defeating the cursed enemy. Celebrate the victors and the brave. Make taking of the spoils of war a glorious thing. Yet also beware of the damaging effects ofextrinsic motivation. When the spoils of war become the main motivation, soldiers lose focus. Ensure your troops do not become as animals, for example by sustaining humanity in the treatment of prisoners. When the enemy's possessions have been taken, the person may be forgiven. Soldier who are captured and abused will hate you forever, as will their friends and family. Treat them well and they will take your part more easily. Doing this also encourages your enemy to likewise."
"This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.","Disabling, capturing and stripping the enemy of their goods only gives you greater strength and avoids collateral damage that causes longer-term harm."
"In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.","The goal is to win, not to overrun everything and everyone. It is to defeat the enemy, not to fight forever. Whilst there may be glory in battle there is also great cost. Beware of letting glory becoming the ends that battle provides. Stories of derring-do are good for later cheer but they are not good for the nation when easier victory can be gained."
"Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.","The actions of the leader will build reputation. A useful reputation to seek is one of just power, where you can and will mete out justice where it is due. When people think you fair, they may fear and will trust you. Respect is a most powerful tool."
"Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.","Destroying the enemy may seem the obvious goal. But capture may result in later wars. Glory may seem to be only found in battle. The enemy seen as evil deserves to be punished severely. Yet this is not the best way. Harming people when it is not necessary creates enduring enmity. On the other hand, showing superiority without fighting invokes awe. A captured force has to give up its weapons. It may be used in negotiations. Through treating them with respect you may draw the sting of their anger against you. In business, it is better to weaken and acquire competitors or go around them, rather than waging expensive competitive battles. When you are seen as superior, you may be able to induce their better people to join you, weakening them further."
Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.,"If the enemy sees that you can defeat them with ease, then few will seek simply to fight to an inevitable and inglorious death. Kindness in capture also weakens resolve and frames you as morally, as well as strategically, superior."
Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.,"Here are the goals to seek in your planning. If you can see what the enemy is planning, you can prepare to pull the rug from beneath their strategic feet. If you cannot see their plans then you may be able to outmanoeuvre them before battle is joined. When they see you have a superior position, they may be forced to concede. Also seek to prevent allies of the enemy joining with them. If you must fight, it is better to fight in open space than where where they have positional advantage. Siege is covered in more detail in the next point. The rules are similar for business. If you can anticipate and out-plan competitors, then you can smoothly and efficiently defeat them."
"The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more.",Laying siege to a strongly defended position is poor in many ways. It is likely to drag on for a long time. It is hard work and takes much resource. Your troops are exposed while theirs are hidden. The sheer cost of siege makes it a final option only.
"The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.","Frustration in the face of an impregnable enemy is a dangerous companion for any leader, as is anyemotion that clouds judgement. In business, managers who are 'action oriented' and like saying things like 'just do it' without considering consequences are in danger of significant subsequent regret."
Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.,"The best way of fighting is to avoid fighting. The best way to win a war is with superior strategy that out-thinks, out-plans and out-maneuvers the enemy such that they are forced to concede or else suffer a humiliating defeat."
"With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.","Fighting wars depletes forces which limits the number of wars a commander can wage. If, however, soldiers are not lost and few munitions are used, then the army may march and march to war, defeating all in its path with little incremental cost."
"It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.","Here are some simple rules of thumb that worked for Sun Tzu. The underlying principles are:1. Surrounding an army requires many men and is likely to spread forces thin unless you have a serious advantage in resources. If an army is surrounded by an overwhelming force, there is no way of escape and the only alternative to overwhelming defeat is to surrender. 2. With sufficient numbers, you can still crush an opposing force, although to do so may lose many men and so should be done with care. A way here is to use flanking and other indirect tactics. 3. With a smaller advantage, you can still use distractions and phalanxes to divide and conquer a monolithic army. A general rule is that if you have more troops than you need in a single situation, them you can gain advantage by employing the excess troops elsewhere."
"If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.","If your men are better trained, better equipped and more motivated, then hand-to-hand combat should succeed. If you are weaker, then it is better to flee and fight another day when you have built advantage in other ways."
"Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.",Glorious suicide is simply madness.
"Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.","Generals control armies. If they are weak then their decisions and orders will be weak. Therefore it is contingent upon the state to appoint consistently strong generals. Likewise in business, the success and failure of any organization hinges upon the competence of the CEO."
There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army:,Leaders are not guaranteed success just because they are leaders.
"(1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.","Commanders who issue orders that cannot be obeyed, for example where the army is pinned down by the enemy or where transportation is not available, only creates angst and conflict in the lower-level leaders on the ground. It also does little for the credibility of those commanders. In business, when the fine strategy hits the realities of the front line, it is often translated into quite different tactics, simply because front-line managers know that it will not work as is. This is sometimes known as 'strategic disobedience'. A common problem is where strategy assumes plentiful resources, whilst the reality is that budgets are thin and people are busy."
"(2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.","Citizens in the country have rights and freedoms and so must be persuaded and cajoled. Armies are regimented and commanded organizations for a good reason. If you ask a soldier if he would like to advance, the result is confusion. Orders to advance should be obeyed without question or delay. As Chang Yu noted, humanity and justice are the principles on which to govern a state. For an army, opportunism and flexibility are key virtues. In business, sales people are often quite a different breed to those back in headquarters. Tasked with selling or being sacked, they easily see corporate politeness and politics as laughable."
"(3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.","When people at the top order people way down the tree of command, it both undermines more senior officers and creates conflicts of loyalty in the ordered person. Such decisions may also be made with insufficient understanding of local conditions. Rigid and blind commands from senior officers have been the downfall of many troops. The rules of war change and fighting by the rules of the previous war brings doom. In the First World War, the orders for steady advance with bayonets fixed met the new machine guns, with ensuing carnage and waste."
"But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.","Soldiers are weapons with intent. If their intent is not clearly honed, it can drift or be turned by others. Trust is a complex and easily lost. If soldiers lose trust in their superiors, then cohesion is loosened and the army will not act as one. The same goes for business. If the CEO is not strong, then the barons on the board will start running their own fiefdoms for their own purposes. And if the employees do not trust managers, they may leave to work for the competition (a major reason for leaving is problems with the manager)."
"Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.","Do not just charge in. Pick your fights. (1) Pick the right time. For example in the early morning when they are still asleep. Or in the Summer, when you will not be bogged down in the snow. (2) You will not always have the greatest force. Yet you can win. Knowing the right fighting strategy is important here. (3) Constancy of purpose and knowing the commander's intent keeps an army together and with a clear, cohesive focus. (4) An army actually spends very little time fighting. When it is not fighting, it should be preparing. Failing to prepare is preparing to fail. So if the enemy is not prepared and you are, then you have huge advantage. (5) Rulers know how to rule civilians. Generals know how to fight. Whilst the ruler's intent is important, strategy and tactics should be left to those who understand it best. These rules are easy to translate into the business context."
"Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.","Self-belief without self-knowledge is a dangerous thing. Knowing yourself without knowing the other side is also dangerous. With full knowledge, you can always win. With weak knowledge you can always fail. Be honest with yourself and know the enemy better than he knows himself. Chang Yu said: ""Knowing the enemy enables you to take the offensive, knowing yourself enables you to stand on the defensive. """
"Sun Tzu said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.","To win, you need the right opportunity, which may take time to find. During that time of unreadiness, you may be defeated and so lose. Defense comes first. In business, if you put all your resources into promoting new products, your cash cows may be exposed to attack."
"To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.","If you have a good defense, you will survive attacks. If you have a weak defense, then even a moderate attack may well succeed. The same is true for your enemy. Understand their defense to know how hard or easy it will be to defeat them. This is the principle of the feint, where a false attack triggers a defensive move that also exposes a weakness. In business, you can make small competitive moves just to see how your competitors react. You can then plan a more effective campaign."
"Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.","The same is true for the individual fighter. If you can block and parry or otherwise avoid their thrusts, you can wait to find an opening through which you can defeat them in a single blow. In this way, two good fighters circle one another and may fight for a long period before one makes a mistake"
Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.,"If you know how to attack or punch well, yet your opponent can defend against all your attacks, then you will still not win. Recognizing good strategy and being able to design and implement it are different things."
Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.,"To avoid losing, you must be able to defend. Knowing this, you can spend too much on building a strong defense. To win, however, you must be able to attack. And so you must also plan and prepare for winning attacks. Chang Yu said: ""Attack is the secret of defense; defense is the planning of an attack. """
"Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.","It can be easier to defend than attack, for example by holding a defensible higher position. In this way weaker forces will defend more, hoping perhaps to see a weakness in their attackers into which they can sally forth. Strong forces can successfully attack a defensive position only if they are strong enough to break through. This may require very significant attacking advantage."
"The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.","The leader must unashamedly know their strengths and weaknesses in both defense and attack and act accordingly. If they are weak in attack, they should seek an unassailable position which is easy to defend. Concealment is an art that does not literally meet going underground. If the enemy cannot find you, you may hide in plain sight. If they cannot see your strength or know your plans, they may make foolish moves. If they are strong in attack, then a fast and powerful thrust can overcome many defenses. Sometimes abilities come from where you live or what you do. People on desirable islands or hilltops may not need to attack, but regularly need to repel invaders, and so develop defensive skills. Those who are aggressive and acquisitive may, through many campaigns, become skilful in attack."
To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.,"When there is a royal road, paved with gold to your goal, with no distractions or threats, then it takes no skill to follow it. Likewise, when many can see the obvious, then doing the obvious can hardly be called 'excellent'. Seeing the unseen is a skill that can help you in many ways. In business, it is easy to succeed in a rising market when there is plenty of demand. Real skill is shown in tougher times."
"Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, ""Well done!""",This is more confusing. See below for why congratulations does not necessarily indicate excellence.
To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.,"A hair is light, as is an autumn leaf. Of course it does not need strength. Similarly, perceiving what is visually or aurally obvious does not indicate acumen. To perceive what is not obvious and understand its significance takes a finer skill. Few have natural talent in fine perception. Few also take time to hone their perceptual abilities. This is what makes those who do appear excellent."
"What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.","A good fighter does not get into difficult fights nor gets into difficult situations. The application of great skill often appears to be done without much effort. This is because it is done with skill, not effort."
Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.,"This answers point 9. Many equate effort and hardship with skill and courage. When it seems you have won with ease, those who do not appreciate your skill will not recognize or credit your ability. When you see what others do not see and think what they do not think, it is not surprising that they neither understand nor appreciate you."
"He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.","As in the principle of defense and attack, we lose by making defensive mistakes that allow an attack through. Mistakes are also made when any waste occurs. What is squandered now may be sorely missed later. The principle is the same in chess and many other situations, including business competitive strategy."
"Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.","Again, as indefense and attack, if you are impregnable, then it takes just a moment of weakness by the enemy where you can slip in and win. And so you must be constantly vigilant and ready."
"Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.","A good strategists sees further ahead than others, plotting the moves and counter-moves until certain victory is known. The first move may hence be seen as oddly innocuous, but moves confidently towards inevitable victory. The higher in business you go, the further into the future you need to see. The ability to see possibilities and take your organisation there is a powerful leadership skill."
"The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.","Remember the Moral Law, plus method and discipline in the Five Constant Factors. Naturally, success with these should lead to success in war."
"In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.",Here are five aspects of the 'military method' which are described in more detail in the paragraphs below.
Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.,"Nothing is certain in war and victory starts with intelligence that allows understanding of risks and opportunities, projecting possibilities for each and then acting on the one with best outcome. In business, risks and opportunities are often based more on opinion than data and calculated projection. Improving this will improve success."
"A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.","Armies that win are superior to those which run away. They have greater advantage and far stronger morale. In business, do not underestimate the power of motivation. Leading people to wins, even small ones, will increase morale and lead to more wins. After failure, work hard to restore morale."
The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.,"Dynamics count. A speeding bullet does far more damage than if it was thrown by hand. The momentum of a powerful charge can break through a even a strong defense. In business, momentum can be caused by a string of successes that keeps competitors on the back foot and may even drive them out of the market."
Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.,"The principles of control and direction are the same, no matter how large the force. The way armies do this is through a strict hierarchy that divides and subdivides, such that the lowest level fighting teams are quite small. The same problem faces businesses: to be able to manage size. Common problem include where the top becomes detached from the front line, and where high-level strategy gets corrupted by the time it reaches operational management. Perhaps industry could learn something here from the military."
Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.,"What is important is that instructions reach the front line quickly. Hierarchies help this as long as there are no blocks or distortion along the way. Signs and signals are ways of communicating, including over distances. A well-managed communications network can get information in both directions, up and down the hierarchy, quickly and efficiently. In business, communication up and down the hierarchy, let alone with peers, is often cited as a problem, including in times of change where misunderstanding of intent and realities can cause real problems."
To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's attack and remain unshaken-- this is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.,"There are two ways in defense: direct and indirect. Direct is yang, cheng, hard, straight, obvious, expected. Indirect is yin, chi, soft, turning, subtle, surprising. Direct and indirect used together lead to confusion and mistakes. Mistakes may be slipped around by indirect or allow a direct thrust. Direct hides inside indirect and indirect hides inside direct. This is a general principle applicable in business and life also."
That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg--this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.,"A grindstone dashed is a grindstone broken. By an egg? Something strong can be broken by something that seems weak, if the physics is understood."
"In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.","Fighting is a direct method. It confronts soldier-to-soldier, and has a cost in life and more. Yet while you may win a fight or win a battle, winning is not victory, which a more complete and final thing."
"Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.","There are many indirect alternatives to fighting, such as flanking and attacking from the rear, which may be used separately, sequentially or in any combination. Indirect methods cause surprise and reaction. Just as the enemy is responding in confusion to an indirect attack, you can apply yet another, to multiply their confusion and ease your victory."
"There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.","Combinations start with few things that are combined into patterns that may succeed or fail. The human genome is like this. There are only four patterns which are repeated in endless ways that create the panoply of mankind. In business, understand how a few simple things combine into many possibilities."
"There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen.","The first step in using combinations is to understand well the elements, the building blocks of patterns. The next stage is composition, designing blends and patterns that suit the situation and mood."
"There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.","In different situations there are different basic elements. If you can classify these and understand them, you can build deliberate combinations."
"In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.","Direct and indirect are two methods that can be used in many confusing combinations, for example with a sequence of indirect feints that move troops followed direct attacks into the holes created. Likewise any two things can combine in many ways, just like the 1101100101 of computer binary. To succeed in business you do not need to always invent new ways of competing. New ways of combining existing methods can be just as successful."
The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?,"This is like yin and yang, breathing in and breathing out. Each thing creates its opposite. Attacking the enemy creates a counter-attack, which may be met with a strategic withdrawal and a pincer movement. Design battle and war in terms of ebbs and flows, indirect and direct, defense and attacks. Winning can also lead to losing as arrogance leads to carelessness. And losing can lead to winning when sadness turns to determination. When you are down, the only way is up. And when you are up, how do you stay up?"
The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course.,"When water flows, it flows fast over, around and under stones, rolling them onwards. When troops flow fast and furious, they will bowl over anything in their path. If you stand before them, then if the first soldier does not knock you down then the next will, or the one after that, each flowing in rapid sequence. Flow happens as a rapid sequence of blows such that the enemy has no time to recover or resist before the next arrives. An example of this happening in business is where a company releases a superb new product then, even before competitors bring out a response, they leapfrog again with another, even better replacement."
The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.,"Timing is critical in many situations and none more so than war. The same thrust will have a very different effect at different times, depending on such factors as weather conditions or the readiness of the enemy. A well-timed attack is efficient and effective, taking advantage of all conditions, including the readiness of your troops and the unreadiness of the enemy. Timing in business is likewise critical. There are often 'market windows' in which you can 'make a killing' or otherwise gain advantage. Outside the window, competitors have established their brand and are much harder to defeat."
"Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.","The above lessons are clear. Get your timing right and, once you start, keep the momentum and flow going."
"Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.","Energy is both potential and kinetic. If you bend a bow, it has static but potential energy. When you release the bow, it has dynamic, kinetic energy. Your decision as to when you release the arrow will determine whether it hits its target or misses. The bent bow is the readiness of your troops. The release bow leads quickly to them flowing in a rapid torrent over the enemy."
"Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.","True disorder is when there is a loss of control. Apparent disorder is where patterns cannot be distinguished. In complex sequences of rapid movement, patterns can be hard to detect. Control amidst the chaos of battle comes with skill, which comes from study, practice and preparation. Businesses can seem chaotic, too, yet if you know why things are, you can stay in control as you weave success in complex marketplaces."
"Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.","When your enemy thinks you have lost control, they will make mistakes. It takes discipline to dance perfectly through chaos. Fear leads to disorder. There is risk in showing fear as it may spur the enemy on. It takes courage to overcome fears and courage to display them. It takes courage to put yourself ad a disadvantage. Yet bydeceiving the enemy thus, you can lead them into mistakes. Likewise it takes strength of character to appear weak, just as it takes an expert piano player to play reliably out of tune. Simulating disorder requires the fine skill of the actor, who is a master deceiver."
Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.,"When acting in a uniform way, you display control. To show disorder, each person must be acting differently. Adding timidity is another action on top of the complexity of battle. Showing apparent weakness requires careful positioning that appears weak whilst hiding strength. Hiding can have a wider range of meaning and may also include keeping your main troops hidden whilst displaying a truly weaker, more timid force."
"Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.","Deceit is natural and we have been called themendacious ape for our tendency towards trickery. It is a skill that, when highly developed, can win wars with little fighting. It can even be said that all war is deceit. There is a lot of deceit in business too, from exaggerated advertising to competitive strategy."
"By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.",Baiting is just one form of deceit. By luring the enemy into traps an easy win may be achieved. Ambush is a common and effective tactic.
"The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.","Combined energy is the effect of using multiple methods or skilled warriors such that their potential is multiplied and the enemy is quickly overwhelmed. Combining has a synergistic effect, where the result is greater than the sum of the parts. Success comes from understanding the power both of the army as a whole and of talented individuals, and how these are best combined."
"When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.","With the ability to sustain forward motion, a group of soldiers or a whole army gains momentum that is difficult to stop."
Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the subject of energy.,Rolling down a mountain uses the potential energy of height to convert to kinetic energy of movement. Momentum is equal to mass times velocity. A smaller force can hence gain high momentum by acquiring high speed.
"Sun Tzu said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.","A saying is 'The early bird captures the worm. ' If you arrive at a battlefield first, you have time to settle, survey the ground and pick your positions and routes. You may also attack opponents as they arrive, preventing them from settling. In business, being first to market gives many advantages, including building market share and establishing your brand as the leader."
"Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.","Taking the initiatives lets you lead the game. When you act first, the other side has to respond. In this way, you can keep them constantly on the back foot. An effective soldier fights on his own terms or not at all."
"By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.","When pressed, your opponent will grab at what appears as opportunities to gain advantage and take the lead. Their desperation will make them less thoughtful and so miss the trap that you set until it is too late. You may also make critical strikes on them to disable movement. Taking out their communication ability is a classic such activity."
"If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.","When the enemy seems to be comfortable, find ways to remove that comfort, sustaining their tension and so preventing preparations and exhausting them before they fight."
Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.,"Act in ways that are economical for you and which are maximally taxing for your opponent. Strike like a snake, in and out quickly. Confuse then and create disarray. When your efforts are consistently less than those of your opponent, they will tire sooner, at which your fresher troops can more easily defeat them."
"An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.","When marching through occupied territory, an army needs constantly to scout around their route and must be in a state of constant readiness. When there is nothing to fear, they can move at speed without caution."
You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.,"Where possible, attack in places which are undefended, such as flanks and the rear. If all areas are defended, select weaker points to attack, where defenses are weakest. In the opposite sense, ensure you have no undefended or weak points that offer the enemy an easy way in."
Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.,"A foolish enemy will assume you will attack only directly. If they are less foolish, you can still keep them on their toes with regular indirect attacks such that they have to distribute their troops everywhere. If you are good at defending, you can hold off a larger force which remains puzzled as to what attacks to use and so does not attack. Ways to do this include taking superior positions and having good intelligence and mobile troops who can reach defensive positions before the enemy arrives. This principle is equally applicable in business. If you can take market share and defend your own, you will grow and grow."
"O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.","When you use camouflage, secrecy and other ways of cloaking your positions and intent, you can act at will, even from within enemy territory. The original words for this paragraph talk about 'without form or sound'. how can you attack a formless enemy?"
"You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.","When attacking through weak points, always sustain the route back home. It does not help to be cut off whilst in enemy territory."
"If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.","A simple way to winkle an enemy out of his hidey-hole is to force him to come to the defense of some other place. Rather than laying siege, attack other places. When the enemy leaves their stronghold to help others, then you can ambush them. It is also possible to feed them false information that other places are being attacked, with the same effect."
"If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.","An advancing army is cautious in case of traps and deception. You can hence deceive by suggesting deception. This will halt them until the suspected problem is resolved. Such bluffing can require bold moves. There is a story of a city being attacked that suddenly threw open its gates to reveal not defenders but people sweeping the ground. Filled with suspicion, the attackers retreated."
"By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be divided.","If you know them and how they are likely to act, then you can make more reliable plans. This includes only defending where they will very likely attack, allowing you to make these forces stronger. If you conceal your thoughts from them, then they cannot do the same to you, so increasing your advantage. They hence need to have defenses set up in many places in case you attack there. If they do not know where your troops are positioned, then they may be paralyzed by indecision and risk. It is often easier to get some information on a diffused force. If your forces are in one position, but concealed, then this adds to the confusion of the enemy. In this way, a concentrated force can gain further advantage. While industrial espionage is frowned upon, it does happen. At the very least it makes sense to try to work out what their strategies may be and to respond accordingly."
"We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.","From your superior knowledge of their methods and intent, you can throw your whole force into the weakest area. With their inferior knowledge about you, they will not know where to strike and so hold back (also to cover their defenses). In business you also have limited resources. If you can use these to good effect you can win even if you have less than your competitors."
"And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.","If they have an inferior force in the first place, then to defend against possibilities, they will be spread exceedingly thin. Even if they cluster together, your superior force will still easily defeat them."
"The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.","When you have identified their weaker spots, even greater secrecy is needed, lest they learn your plans and rush to shore up the defense at your point of attack. Even if they have a superior overall force, you can make them place an inferior force at each position by concealing your intent. In this way, your inferior total force can defeat their superior total force."
"For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.","The 'van' is the vanguard, the forces at the front. To strengthen any one part requires taking troops from elsewhere, so weakening that source. When forces are spread evenly, each point is equally weak or strong. If you have a force greater than this 'average' then you can penetrate any defense they have. There is skill in knowing how to spread the concentration of troops, including allowing the enemy smaller wins in order that your larger force can achieve a greater victory."
"Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.",The number of troops at any position is reduced by the need to spread defenses and increased by a lack of need to defend in many positions.
"Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.","When you know when and where a battle will be, then you have time to bring more troops to the battlefield. The longer you have, the further the distance you can move them and hence, even if your troops are dispersed, you can assemble a powerful host. Timing can be critical in battles, including late but timely arrival of reinforcements that can turn fortunes around."
"But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!","If there is no time to bring in reinforcements or rearrange troops, then your defenses are as they are now, without chance of rearrangement or strengthening. In business there are many surprises and the action of competitors may mean you have to react. Preparation is key here. If you have seen the scenario and readied yourself then you may be able to respond sufficiently."
"Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.","Having more soldiers is an advantage, but it is not the only way that advantage can be gained. Superior strategy and tactics can enable a far smaller force to win. The business world is rife with stories of small companies that beat much bigger companies. Superior strategy and stronger motivation go a long way towards success."
"Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.","It is usually not a good idea to take on a superior force. It is better to avoid a fight and even better to manage the situation so they cannot fight, for example by cutting their supply lines or superiormaneuvers."
"Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.","With provocation, the enemy will be forced into action, whereby you can study how they operate. If a provoked force leaps forward ready for action, then this is different to them hunkering down to defend. A way of provoking a volatile commander is to proffer insults and scorn. You can also learn much by how they behave when they are not fighting, for example whether they simply relax or engage in structured preparations."
"Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.","Compare your army with the enemy in all dimensions, understanding in each who is superior and by how much. For example you can consider number of troops, weapons (numbers and type), speed of movement, communication, innovative use of tactics, and so on. Perhaps the most critical comparison is between the senior officers of each side. Where you are superior, there is the place to take advantage. Where you are weaker, then there is the place for caution."
"In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.","In war, spying and intelligence is a subtle and important strand of activity. The enemy may infiltrate their own people into your troops. Your officer may be bribed or blackmailed. Hidden observers may see your preparations. This means that the more important your intent, the more secret you must keep it, right up until deployment. Knowing who you can absolutely trust is also very important."
How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.,"If you know what the enemy is doing, you can respond accordingly. In this way, their actions shape your actions. Of course there is always danger in reacting where this gives them the upper hand or where your reactions are predictable and so allow them to gain further advantage."
"All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.","Tactics are implemented actions that are each a part of a grander strategy. If you understand the strategy, you may be able to predict likely tactics. Seeing tactics is about the present, what is being done now. This does not mean you can conclude what preparations were required, nor what future actions will be taken. Good tactics do not give away the strategy. They surprise the enemy or cause him to believe you are using a strategy that is different from you actual strategy."
"Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.","When you are successful in using one method it is very tempting to repeat this. Yet military success often comes from the surprise created. Lightning is very unlikely strike the same thing twice. It is similarly very unlikely that the same tactic will create the same surprise twice (at least against the same enemy). Innovation is a critical part of business, and not just in product design. Strategic innovation includes surprising market moves and changes in direction that keeps competitors guessing."
Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.,Water is moved by the natural potential energy of gravity. It goes where it will go and does not return. There are many variables in war and what worked in one situation is not guaranteed to work elsewhere. Design the tactics for the situation rather than just 'using what worked last time'.
"So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.","Fighting a strong force is a good way of losing troops, yet many combatants have thought the only way to win is through direct conflict. There are many alternatives and only a fool dashes himself against a rock."
Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.,"Water flows around things rather than trying to move them. In doing so it sustains its momentum and reaches its destination. In the end, success lies in the hands of the individual soldier, who must respond to the situation in front of him, right now. At the same time, commanders must direct the flow of troops to best advantage."
"Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions.","Water is fluid. It does not have the fixed shape of rock. It cannot move a fixed rock, but it can wear it down. It can roll stones out of the way and carry sand along with it. Success is gained not just by grand strategy but also by adapting to the situation on the field of play."
"He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.","In Tai Chi, you seek great sensitivity to feel the slightest movement of the other person and respond simultaneously. In war, the principle is the same: sense and respond, while also seeking the higher goal. Chess is a war game in which players spend much time thinking 'if she does that, I will do this, then if she does this, I will respond like that. . ' and so on. The players that win are those who can see more moves ahead and cope with all possibilities. Businesses sometimes focus so much on executing the defined strategy they forget to see how it is working out in practice. Having a closed loop of rapid learning and change can be very powerful."
"The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.","When you break things down to the fundamental elements, you may find that those basic patterns do not appear equally and have different impacts. Nothing is constant and stable, not even atoms. All is in flux. A pictures is a snapshot in time, yet life is a three-dimensional dynamic. Yet there are also predictable patterns amongst interactional dynamics. The four seasons, for example, always follow each other in a predictable sequence. If you can understand the basic elements, how they work and interact, and how they form predictable patterns, then you will be able to create and predict many things."
"Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.","The ultimate command comes from the ruler of the country. The general's purpose is to achieve the intent and goals set by this ruler. As with any goal-setting, it is important for the ruler to have achievable aspirations. A wise rules discusses possibilities with the general before settling on the final command. It is then important for the ruler to allow the general to use his skills to develop the strategy to achieve the intended ends. In business, the CEO and board set the objectives that are executed further down the organization. This says much about the importance of selection and of trust."
"Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.","Putting together a fighting force has many options, for example creating an elite brigade or spreading the best men to create a wider capability. The way the troops and weapons are organized depends on the strategic intent and planned maneuvers. In business as in war, a difficult question is where to put your best people. There is no magic formula for this but your choice can be critical."
"After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.","With a clear intent and organized force, the next step is to get them into motion. Maneuvering involves moving. Good maneuvering is like playing chess, where much of the game is about positioning in order to secure effective attacks that lead inexorably to victory. In business, strong execution is very important. You can strategize all you like, but if you can't do what you planned, you are likely in deep trouble."
"Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation.","In planning maneuvers, it should be remembered that the other army will also be maneuvering, leading to a form of 'dance'. The general who understands the other side's maneuvers will most likely win. Good maneuvers includesurprise, for example where the enemy thinks you are behind them, then finds you have slipped past them and are in front. This is the skill of the general. In business, manuvering is also important, and a surprised competitor is one who is put off their footing. For example when they are enticed to great expenditure for no real gain."
"Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.","Moving quickly takes a fit army that is ready to pick up and go far into hazardous territory. Rapid movement often has little time for preparation or scouting. To take on such challenges needs motivated and ready troops. In business, sometimes you have to move quickly to take advantage of an opportunity or respond to competitive action. In such cases, there is little time for planning, training and other preparation. You must see the need and move quickly, and your people must be ready also. This is one reason why preparation and practice is so important: there is no time on the day."
"If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.","For speed of response, units that must move quickly will have little time to pack. To move quickly, they also will not be able to carry much with them. A way of handling this is to have different units, some able to move quickly with others arriving later as reinforcement."
"Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.",Rapid maneuver seldom has time for the cautious advance of normal warfare. It is hence quite possible that your light and mobile force will meet one which is stronger. The loss of troops is a price that must be considered. However the gains from maneuvers may lead to many other lives being saved through the shortening of the war and reduction in pitched battles.
"The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.","When a group of people are all hurrying, they will naturally spread out with the faster going ahead and the slower falling behind. The same may be true of military units. The result can be that when the front troops reach the enemy position they are seeking, they will be few in number. This means you cannot depend on all or, indeed, many of the troops you dispatch on the mission to reach the final goal in force, and so you must plan accordingly."
"If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.",Travelling a long way will result in loss both from spreading out of forces and particularly those few at the front taking most damage as they encounter enemy troops.
"If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.","The shorter the distance that troops march, the closer together they will be, the less chance of ambush and less falling at the wayside from exhaustion. In business if you work your people too much, you will lose some who leave, others will fall sick from stress and over-work and others will give up and work only in body but not in spirit."
We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.,"An army, as they say, marches on its stomach. Supplies of food and all the other requirements of living keep the army not just alive but motivated and strong. Short maneuvers work without a supply line, but they cannot hold out forever, and so need the main force to catch up soon."
We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.,"History is full of alliances that turned into treachery. If another offers a hand, ask 'What do they really seek? What is in it for them?'When you know their true desires and intent, you can then determine whether to ally with them and how you can trust them."
"We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.","To march across unknown lands is to risk finding unfordable rivers and unscalable cliffs. If you do not know what is ahead, you may be caught in an ambush in a narrow defile where you cannot fight with strength. If you do not know the land you risk others being on high ground and miss advantages you can gain. Wars are often spent around hills, with one force on top and the other at the bottom, trying to dislodge them. It is hence imperative to understand well the land ahead. If you do not have maps this means sending out scouts. The principle is true in business for knowing anything that is ahead. As far as you can see, so you can be prepared."
We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.,"Scouting can only tell you so much. Natives who have lived there will know much more than you possibly can, so make use of them. In business, find those who know and understand things at a depth that you cannot, then learn from them. One resource that is often forgotten is your own front-line people who meet and deal with customers every day. What would be different if executives had such knowledge?"
"In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.","'Dissimulation' is 'the act of deceiving'. Deceit is a common and critical method of wrong-footing the enemy. Deceit is also common in business when deliberately keeping a competitor uncertain and less confident. Of course deceiving customers, employees or partners is a bad idea."
"Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.","There are various rules for deciding whether troops should be spread out or brought together, for example in the need to defend a wide front. Yet in the end, each decision has many complicating factors and must be carefully considered. In business, we often seem to blindly apply rules because 'that is what should be done' and then are surprised when our decisions fail. Yet if we took time to understand and think we might have decided otherwise."
"Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest.","When you need to move fast, move fast. When you need to form a close group, knit together. Whatever you need to do, do it well. We get to do things well when we plan and practice. Knowing what you need to do is not enough: you must be able to do it."
"In raiding and plundering be like fire, is immovability like a mountain.","Yet again, do whatever you do, well. Fight like a demon. Defend like a rock."
"Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.","Keep plans secret and on a need-to-know basis. When you speed to the attack, go fast to build unstoppable momentum."
"When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery.","Do remember to reward your troops for the efforts they make. This is a chance to show that you care about your people and that you are fair and equitable. Thus motivated, they will fight harder for you. These days, when cameras are everywhere and armchair generals spout civilian morality, there is controversy over the spoils of war. In business, there are still many spoils, from competitive bonuses to taking key management posts in acquisitions. Beware of the demotivational effects of rewards, where people do not get the recognition they think they deserve."
Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.,"While speed is important, there is also 'more haste, less speed'. The more risky the move the more care is needed. But that does not mean risks should not be taken. Perhaps the most important skill is in making good decisions with limited data, as often is the case in war (and in business)."
He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation. Such is the art of maneuvering.,'Deviation' can mean being devious. It can also mean turning off an intended path. Both are relevant as deception is already known as important and changing one's course can be helpful for taking opportunities or surprising the enemy.
"The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags.","Communications has always been a problem. Historically, this has been done by runners and signals. Even today, if electronic communications fail then simpler fall-back methods must be employed. In business, communication may pass through many channels. It is not enough to think that a simple email will suffice."
"Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular point.","If you want many people to be able to understand a communication, it must be broadcast in a way that they can all sense and understand. Communication is what people understand, not what is transmitted. Of course you also have to take into account the possibility of the enemy understanding and responding to your signals. This is why they are often sent in code. Loud and visible communications are effective in business where there are many distractions. This method can be used for both employees and customers."
"The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men.","When people form a group, they act as a 'herd', along with the herd mentality that impels them to act in the same way as others around them. Hence a large group can be moved by a small group within. This is how leadership can happen."
"In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.","Use whatever communication is appropriate to the context. The bottom line is that whatever the situation, your troops must be able to hear and act on your orders."
A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.,"The 'spirit' of the army is its dynamic motivation and energy to engage in warfare. When an army starts out, its spirit is high. When it has achieved great victory, its spirit is high. In between, it takes work to keep up their spirit. Spirit can be greatly affected by leadership. If the commanders are positive and energized, they can give rousing speeches that raise the spirit of the whole army. When their spirit is low, they may make bad decisions. Therefore it is important to sustain the spirit of the army and especially its offices. The same is true in business. Spirited leaders can make a huge difference to their workforce."
"Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.","Rest improves spirit. A good breakfast helps too. After a day of marching or fighting, spirits flag. Even a day of inaction can make soldiers listless and depressed."
"A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.","Hence if you can engage the enemy when your spirit is high and theirs is low, then you have a significant advantage. Likewise it is unwise to engage when the spirits of your people are low."
"Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art of retaining self-possession.","There is much in warfare that in civilian situations would cause panic and disorder. Such discomfort is a waste of energy, draining spirit and creating a dangerous state of unreadiness. A lack of discipline is also a recipe for chaos and panic. Disciplined troops are quietly confident and are in control of themselves. With external discipline they gain internal self-discipline and so can reach a state of calm in the hardest of circumstances. Calmness does not mean lethargy or a lack of readiness. The calm warrior is always ready. They just do not need to sustain a state of tension to be observant and able to respond at a moment's notice. The same is true in business. Those who have an assured calm make better leaders and are more successful. They are not lazy. They are just  conserving their energies for where true value can be created. A lack of calm is often shown as stress, which can wear people out and break them without external intervention."
"To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.","Strength, motivation and spirit are what you need in battle. When you are not fighting or marching, you should conserve the energies you will need later. If you can cause your enemy to lose their calm, always keeping them on edge, then when you meet you will have a significant advantage."
"To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.","Striking at the enemy requires good timing. Panicked troops or those who want only to fight will lash out. Keeping cool and calm lets you wait for the right moment. It also requires calm to stand firm or retreat in an orderly way in the face of an advancing superior force. To be faced with a calm army is in itself fearful. In war, those who lose their cool first may consequently lose the fight."
"It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.","Being above the enemy gives the advantage of potential energy. You can use gravity to move things down on them, from rolling rocks to projected missiles. You stand higher than them and can swing down on top of them. There is also a subtle motivational psychology where height is a very common metaphor for superiority. People who are higher feel superior whilst people who are lower feel inferior. With this effect, they may well be motivated and demotivated in a battle. This can be seen in animals who prefer to stand higher. In humans also, height is a symbol of status. There are more taller people in senior business roles. Kings sit on daises."
Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.,"When the enemy runs away unexpectedly or shows a weaker force than expected, beware of chasing them as they run as they may well be leading you into an ambush. Soldiers whose tempers are aroused go into a 'berserker' mode and lose all fear. While they may make mistakes in this unthinking mode, they will be faster and stronger than usual."
Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.,"Deceit is a common in strategy and tactics. Watch for things that seem easy, for they may easily be a dangled bait, designed to catch the unwary with a hidden hook that will snag and prevent escape. Also, if an army is in final retreat back to its homeland, then pursuing it may result in more loss than gain. If you can win the war by ceasing hostilities now, why waste lives further? It is a basic principle of maneuvering to win without fighting. There may be good reason for pursuing a retreating army, for example if they are retreating only to regroup or re-arm. Deception is also common in business and a easily provoked competitor is one who may be easily defeated."
"When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.","When a foe is cornered, they must fight for their lives and will do so with the energy of final fear. If you force them to go down in a blaze of glory they will do so, taking more of your troops than you might otherwise expend. Also, slaughtering an army will gain you the enmity of their family and country, who will arise at a later time to take revenge. It is often better to allow a graceful retreat in the direction of your choosing. This is offering the enemy a 'golden bridge'. Once you have shown your superiority, you will be able to negotiate an advantageous peace."
Such is the art of warfare.,"Such indeed, for despite the rules and science discussed, there is much art and cunning that may be found between the admonishments of Sun Tzu. Many disciplines, from painting to swordplay, start as a science, with the student following strict patterns and rules. With practice, they begin to feel the subject rather than obeying it. In this way it becomes art. That deeper connection then allows the student to effectively develop their personal style and so become a master."
"Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces","When you know your objectives, you can then direct your armies to the right places. A concentrated force can have a powerful effect. A nail can be hammered through hard wood. A sharp knife slices through resistant material. Even a small force, if concentrated at a single point can punch through. In business, when you know the business intent and direction, you can then formulate how to focus."
"When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In desperate position, you must fight.","Setting up camp takes time. Whilst encamped, soldiers are in relaxed disarray. Packing up also takes time. Camps are hence vulnerable to attack and cannot respond or move quickly. Holding crossroads allows you to command multiple routes. High places are easier to defend. High routes are often ways between more comfortable low places. Hence if you hold high crossroads you have great advantage. Use of allies to hold these places allows the main army to continue without loss of resource. Even pausing in dangerous places, where you are particularly vulnerable, gives greater opportunity for the enemy to find and attack you. When you are hemmed in, with few ways out, you have fewer mobility options and hence a greater need for deception or other strategies. When your back is against the wall, you have no option but to fight. The above options suggest ways to avoid this worst-case situation."
"There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.","Sometimes a direct route to the enemy's capital seems obvious, but it may be well-guarded and make you vulnerable, for example if it goes through narrow canyons or crosses wide rivers. Just because there is an army in front of you, it does not mean you should attack it, even if you think you can win. Always consider the war first, and not just the battle. Arousing neutral countries can multiply your enemies. Attacking a smaller force can create losses that will make you vulnerable to a later larger force. Avoid siege and other conflicts that are not advantageous or necessary. In war, the general takes commands from the sovereign, but the sovereign is not on the battlefield and does not know what will bring ultimate victory. Only a foolish general would implement commands they know will fail."
The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.,"Knowing tactics is not enough. You need to know when to use them. In particular there is skill in matching the tactics to both the situation and to one another. In this way, a sequence of simple tactics can be as varied and powerful as DNA, which is a simple sequence of only four elements. In business, you can have a great strategy but if you cannot translate it into a solid yet adaptive execution then it will all be for naught."
"The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.",Knowing the terrain is not enough. Knowing the weather is not enough. Knowing your troops is not enough. Knowing the enemy is not enough. You must also know what tactics will be effective in the specific situation you face.
"So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.","You can learn tactics by two methods. First, you can learn from experience. A cheaper way is to learn what has worked and what has not worked in the past for others. The best generals are both continuous students and experienced practitioners. Through this combination they can learn what will work even before they have used it. It is easy in business to speak with certainty. It is harder to have the humility to learn."
"Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.","Advantage is a two-sided coin. When you do not have advantage, the other side has advantage and you have disadvantage. At any one time, you have both advantage and disadvantage. Plans and actions need to take heed of both."
"If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.","Above all, a commander must be realistic. It is easy to be gung-ho and it is easy to be overly cautious. It takes skill to walk the best line between."
"If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.","Ahead always lies paths of advantage and disadvantage and these constantly change in the maneuvers of war and the ebbs and flows of battle. If you pay close attention to these, you have the opportunity to shore up disadvantage and grasp the moments of advantage. Likewise in business, companies go through times of advantage and disadvantage. It is easy in both times to assume this will continue. Better is to plan with knowledge of real advantage and the locus ahead."
"Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.","Here are three ways of gaining advantage. 1. Inflicting damage that reduces their ability to fight and throws their plans into disarray. 2. Making trouble for them that keeps them busy and steadily exhausts them. 3. Proffering bait, especially when they are oppressed and will grasp at straws, which can lure them into ambush."
"The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.",Any war can be won if you can always defend successfully. The best strategy is hence to always ready to take on the enemy at any time.
"There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.","Here are five sins or faults that must be avoided. 1. Recklessness is making decisions based on anger, hope or other dangerous emotions. It is better to make decisions using knowledge and facts. 2. In war you cannot but make decisions. A decision not to fight when it is necessary leads to flight and capture and losing all the same. Not only does cowardice lose the war, it also results in shame and dishonor. 3. A commander or simple soldier who is easily provoked is one who is easily defeated by the cunning enemy. Provocation which leads to anger also leads to hasty action and falling into traps. 4. A sense of honor is mostly a good thing, but it can be hazardous when the thought of shame leads to losing actions, such as entering into a battle that cannot be won. 5. Caring for your soldiers is also a good thing unless taken to excess, whereby fear for their safety can lead to unwise strategic decisions. In war, generals must be ready to send their soldiers to their deaths in order to achieve the greater goal of victory. These rules apply to business too, where recklessness and other foolhardiness can be very expensive."
"These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.","It is not easy being a leader. There are many ways to lose and fewer to win. To succeed, you must know how to avoid failure just as much how to win through."
"When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.","The five sins are common, which is why they have been singled out. If you can avoid these, you will avoid many of the problems that beset armies."
"Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.","Although high places can be strategically important to hold, when on the march they may yet offer a net disadvantage. High places are not the same as smaller hills which give sight all around and which can be comfortably defended. High places can be bare, cold and lack resources for keeping the army fed. Armies in high places may also be spotted from multiple other locations. High places can leave you with your back to a mountain with the only route being down. This can lead to you becoming trapped. Valleys offer more space in which to manoeuver. You can hide a large army in a valley, with only a few sentries in the high places to prevent ambush."
"Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.","If you must camp high, doing so facing the sun will provide more warmth to compensate for the cold (although armies can hide more effectively in the shade). It is good to be in high places to fire down on an enemy below, but fighting in high places is difficult unless you know the terrain well. It is harder to move and the crags may hide enemies who know the territory better than you."
"After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.","Rivers form boundaries that are difficult to cross easily. It is hence easy to become trapped against a river. Likewise, any boundary can result in you being hemmed in. Boundaries can also be defensive, particularly when enemies cannot cross them."
"When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.","If you try to meet the enemy as they start crossing the river, they may retreat or fire at you from the other bank. If you let as much of the opposing force cross that you can easily defeat, then you can complete this task whilst the remaining force struggles to cross the river. By dividing their army in this way, you can defeat a superior force. This is just one variant on the 'divide and conquer' principle."
"If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.","If the enemy sees you coming and are able to cross the river before you arrive, then they can use the previous tactic, defeating you when a smaller force has crossed the river."
"Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.","Upriver is like uphill. When your boats are upriver, you can use the current to sweep down on them. You can also drift quietly down at night to them. Always use the natural advantages that terrain may offer you."
"In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.","Salt marshes are large, flat, hazardous expanses that are found in river deltas. More generally, they represent difficult open terrain where the army is exposed and where it is difficult to fight or even rest when marching. As such, it is best to estimate the size of the marshland and seek to get across within a day. Alternatives includes boats by sea or moving further upriver. In business there are many ways to be exposed and open to attack. Wherever you are, constantly review possible threats."
"If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt-marches.",Long grass can provide low cover. Water can provide subtle cover too. Trees behind you can provide cover or a means of protecting one's rear. 'So much for salt marshes' shows the author's distaste for such difficult places.
"In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.","The easiest of territories for marching is flat, dry ground, across which an army can travel quickly. Enemies can be seen from a distance and preparations made, for example by moving uphill to a stronger position. The point about rising ground to the right and not the left seems likely to be relevant to a particular situation. In practice, either may be equally good or one preferred due to other terrain factors."
These are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.,"The four terrains that affect marching are high ground, rivers, salt marshes and dry level ground. In general the idea is to understand the ground over which you are travelling, knowing the advantage and disadvantage these may confer. In business, the changing competitive landscape also provides contexts to be avoided and points at which decisions are needed."
All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.,"High ground seems safer as attack from above is more difficult. Sunny places are just warmer and more cheerful (except in hot countries). Always consider the environment, not only for the advantage it gives but also the motivation and comfort."
"If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.",Soft marshes attract flies and other animals that spread disease. Soldiers live in close proximity and illness is another enemy. A contagious or infectious disease can defeat an army all by itself.
"When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.","Troops will be warmed by the sun on a slope. Occupying a slope allows you to sweep down on an enemy. With the slope behind you, you face the oncoming army. It does not matter whether it is left or right."
"When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.","When there are no bridges, roads lead to the wider and slower stretches of rivers which can then be crossed on foot. It does not take much depth to sweep a man off his feet. A fast-flowing stream need only be about up to his knees. Hence, attempting to cross a swollen ford (and white flecks are a sure sign) would result in the loss of many soldiers."
"Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached.","The best country for easy movement is open and clear. Cliffs, rivers, and so on are obstacles that must be surmounted or another route found. Barriers to free movement also offer places for enemies to entrap and corner you. If you do not wish to hold a place, them easy passage is the main preference."
"While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.","Just as obstacles can be trouble for you, so also can they be trouble for enemies, especially those who do not know the lie of the land. You can use obstacles to ambush or generally make like difficult for the other side. This is another reason why scouting ahead can offer you advantage."
"If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.","Beware of terrain that could hide enemy armies or even individual soldiers who could attack, spy on you or conduct other activities. If such places cannot be avoided, then take time to investigate them to ensure they are safe. It is also good to post guards to ensure that the enemy does not later creep into such places. In business, beware of subtle competitor action. At conferences, for example, watch for their spying action or seduction of customers."
"When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.","An enemy that does not attack or does not flee is likely confident where they are. If you cannot see their advantage, be very wary. It is also possible that they can see no advantageous action. To know this, look for signs of confusion in their camp. In business, if a competitor is not taking competitive action, ask yourself why."
"When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.","An enemy that avoids an all-out fight does so for a reason. If they repeatedly provoke you and then retreat, they clearly want you to follow, perhaps to a place of their choosing for the battle or into an ambush. Beware of business competitors who make weak provocation. They may be testing you or seeking to drain your resources in ineffective responses."
"If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.","Beware an enemy which seems relaxed. If it seems easy that you can walk into their territory and especially into their encampment, they are either very foolish or are seeking to ambush you."
Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.,"Watch for signs of movement, not just of their troops but also of undergrowth where they may be hiding. Also be suspicious of what appears to be natural cover in an area where there is no other cover."
The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.,"Birds will rise when startled, not just when men are around. The arrival of a large force will startle a large number of birds. Even a few birds rising may indicate an unknown number of troops moving in the area. Learn to read the signs that nature offers you about the presence and movement of troops, both near and afar. In business, look for the weak and indirect indicators of competitive action, such as busy suppliers and silent customers."
"When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.","When the ground is dry, men and machines will kick up dust and send signals that can be seen many miles away. Learn to read the distant signs of different types of activity."
Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.,"The enemy will try to deceive you in their speech and visible actions, most typically by trying appear they are deciding what they are not. Appearing to leave is hence intended to relax you, while appearing to prepare for battle is intended to make you pause."
"When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.","Light chariots, like light modern armor, are a combination of fast and powerful, intended to race to more distant places. In particular when they are on the wings, they are likely to be used forflanking orencirclement. They could also, of course, be used just to make you think this will happen."
Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.,"In a military arena where both sides agree to a tacit code, then both will likely follow that code, but nothing else. Where the code says that a sworn covenant will be followed, but anything else is allowed, then only the covenant can be believed. Understand the codes that your enemy will follow, including of honor and dishonor. If the code is 'All's fair in love and war' then do not even believe a covenant. One thing that may happen is where an enemy has different codes to you, but acts as if they follow the same codes, so deceiving you. In civilian life, codes are equivalent tovalues."
"When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.","Running about and apparent disorder may be a sign of actual disorder, but it may also be a ruse. Watch for the disorder turning into order."
"When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.","Armies tend to advance or retreat in unison unless the majority take fright and a few suicidally brave souls remain. Watch also for any retreat that does not make sense. If the enemy seems to be gifting you, then it is very likely a deceit that is designed to entrap you."
,Lining up against you without further action is an unusual tactic. It may be done to unsettle you. It may be a precursor to an attack. It may be distraction to gain your attention whilst subterfuge is carried on elsewhere. Consider the situation with care. Be alert on all fronts. Decide on your next moves with care. This could include waiting them out.
"If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.","When you have many tactics at your fingertips, then a direct conflict of two equal forces is wasteful and risky. Better to use your superior skill in other ways."
He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.,"Always think before acting. Battles are won in the planning, even though the plans may have to vary once battle commences. If you are not prepared for their moves, then their moves will likely be successful. All it takes is one failure on your part and you lose the battle."
"If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.","Many people, even today, in command still use the stick before the carrot, believing this is the way to gain compliance. Few soldiers are, by nature, submissive. Starting out with a hard approach risks creating grudges and consequent truculence and subterfuge. If you first get their respect, however, then they will accept punishment more easily."
"Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory.","The principle of bonding applies here, including gainingtrust andrapport. Care must be taken here, however, as interacting with soldiers is not the same as with civilians. Just being 'nice' is not enough and is likely to lose respect. Give respect in order to get respect. Be reliable and honest. As long as discipline is seen as fair, albeit harsh, and you are seen as competent, then it will far more likely be accepted."
"If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.","Never let a command be ignored as this is teaching soldiers that commands are optional. Once a command is given, it should be seen through, although this should not make you blind. If it appears that the command was unwise, it can be changed with another firm command."
"If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.","When you expect a high performance from people, and they seek your approval, then they will strive to meet your expectations. In business, showing confidence includes avoidingmicromanagement and other poor and disrespectful techniques."
"Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1) Accessible ground; (2) entangling ground; (3) temporizing ground; (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great distance from the enemy.","Here are six different types of terrain which are described in more detail in paragraphs below. Understanding is at the heart of any success. War is fought on the land, which means understanding the land is a core route to success. Likewise in business there is virtual and geographic territory. Understanding this is key to success."
Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.,"When something is accessible for you, it likely will also be accessible for your enemies. On open ground, a much stronger army will likely prevail, although even this is open to attacks from all sides."
"With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.","Accessible ground need not be level, just easy to traverse. Within this, some places will be more advantageous than others. These are worth occupying first. In accessible ground you may travel far, creating the need for a long and vulnerable supply line which your enemy may try to sever. Effort should be put into protecting this life-giving umbilical cord."
Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called entangling.,"Ground that is hard to re-occupy includes hills, forests and other areas that give good cover. Such places are good to keep once you have occupied them. It is important to try to prevent enemies from taking such ground."
"From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.","Entangling ground is good for defending, so unless you are confident of a winning sortie, it may be better to take a defensive stance and let your enemy wear himself out on your defenses. The worse case is where you leave and cannot return, perhaps because you are cut off or your enemy has taken the entangling ground whilst you were away."
"When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.","Stalemate can ensue from equality, for example where both hold entangling ground or where there is a disadvantageous obstacle in the way. Sometimes when neither army is motivated to fight, being equal and bereft of ideas, the ground may be taken as temporizing when it is not."
"In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.","Beware of being lured out of a strong position, especially if the enemy also holds a strong position. If going forward is disadvantageous then the alternative is to go sideways or backwards. If in doing so you can lure the enemy out into open ground, then you can gain advantage."
"With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.","Narrow passes are dangerous if the ground above can be taken and the people below showered from above. If the land above is untenable, then the pass may be held with only a few people, such as in the Spartan adventure at Thermopylae. Building walls and a defensive garrison can turn a pass into an impregnable castle."
"Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.","If the other side gets to the pass first and has created a garrison, attacking this is wasteful and likely futile, like laying siege. The best hope is that the enemy is careless and has insufficient guards, allowing you to charge in with a wholesale attack, or maybe creep in at night."
"With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.","If you can occupy a high place that is warm enough, and if the enemy is obliged or motivated to attack such a position, then the height can give you a strong advantage as you fire down on him from this natural stronghold."
"If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.","As with entangling ground, the best approach when the enemy is in a position of defensive strength is to lure rather than directly attack. In general, when the enemy is stronger, then the best tactics are those of subterfuge and surprise."
"If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.","When you are far away but wish to fight, them you must approach them over ground that may tire your troops and which may be hazardous and unfriendly, such that when you reach the enemy your troops are exhausted and in poor condition for a fight."
These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.,"As with other rule sets, these are derived from Sun Tzu's learning and experience. Study these to determine what you can use to best effect."
"Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5) disorganization; (6) rout.","The general of an army has many responsibilities, not only to win the war but also avoid failures and ignominy. The general represents the ruler on the battlefield and any loss and shame is felt directly by the ruler."
"Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.","There are many variables and tactics in war that a general can use. The most primitive approach is for the two armies to meet on a battlefield and just throw themselves at each other. When it is simple force against simple force like this, then the laws of physics say that the greater force will win. This can seem like a strong and honorable approach yet vanity in war is more like foolishness. It is foolish even for the stronger force, as they could avoid many deaths by using superior tactics. In business, it is often tempting for large companies spend their way out a competitive situation, for example with pricey advertising campaigns. This is not the only way."
"When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is insubordination. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.","Weak command is always bad, but when soldiers who are allowed to disobey it leads to damaging disorder. It is bad enough in business when people do not obey commands, but in war it is far worse, where concerted and precise action is critical."
"When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.","Armies succeed through coordinated command and action. When individual commanders do not respect the general, when they reject higher orders, or when they act on their own initiative without coordination, then the whole mission is in danger. This effect appears in business where individual business departments and units act as independent 'silos', seeking individual success, often at the expense of other internal groups. With this wasteful inner division, customers and shareholders lose out."
"When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.","The higher the officer, the clearer and stronger must be the command, with distinct responsibilities at the next level down the hierarchy. Any failure in this system leads to problems propagating down the tree. The modern British army uses something called 'the commander's intent'. Much attention is paid to understanding this, so even if units get separated, they can still use their initiative towards the single goal. In business, senior strategy often flops as varying management and local interpretation leads to a misaligned and uncoordinated set of tactics."
"When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be rout.","In war, intelligence is key, and knowing your enemy's strength is a critical part of this. The troops on the front line act as a shield for the rest of the army. If the front line is penetrated then further problems ensue. It hence is important to have strong front-line troops. In business, the customer surface, where people touch customers on a regular basis, is an important part of the brand. It is strange how many big-name companies outsource sales and service calls to companies who do the brand a daily disservice."
"These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.","There are many ways of failing. These are important ones. Note how many of these are about leadership. Without good leadership and good management, both war and business will fail. You are as good as your worst officer or manager."
"The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.","There are many variables in war. The general who understands and makes use of these increases the chance of victory. Failure is often a result of failing to address such factors, of not including them in calculations or making poor assumptions rather than seeking clear intelligence. War is hence more of a science than an intuitive art. There is much science also in business. Whilst there is room for qualitative analysis and decision-making, a quantitative foundation is always a sound approach."
"He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.","You not only need to know things, you have to use them in the right way. Both of these steps have to be made. History is littered with failures to understand and failures to apply what is understood."
"If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.","Whilst it is important to obey commanders, the final choice has to be made on the battlefield where officers have fuller knowledge of the situation. Officers in the field hence have a great responsibility to do what is right to achieve the overall victory. It is important that this is permitted and officers trained to make such decisions correctly."
"The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.","When personal ambition and seeking of glory or promotion takes precedence, the higher goals of victory are lost. The greatest generals are those who are driven first by higher goals, to serve their rulers and their country."
"Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.","Thebond between a parent and their children is very strong. 'Blood is thicker than water' as the saying goes. The greatest bond is where people would willingly die for one another. A bond this strong will mean your people will trust you and follow you anywhere. It also means you must actively care for them. Businesses that build bonds with their employees engender fierce loyalty, encourage additional work levels and cut the many costs of attrition."
"If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.","Parents, having no practice at the art, often spoil their children by giving them too much. Spoilt children petulantly expect to be given what they want without responsibilities nor earning their rewards. The best way of parenting and the best way of leading soldiers is both to love them and to set high expectations that they will responsibly seek to achieve the best they can."
"If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","If you are ready for attack and the enemy are likewise ready, you will still have a difficult assault on your hands. In business, this level of intelligence about what competitors are doing can be very valuable."
"If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.","Knowing the readiness or otherwise of the enemy for battle is an important piece of intelligence. If you do not know your own readiness, you will not be able to take advantage of such an opportunity. In business as in war, knowing when and how to act to greatest advantage is very important."
"If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.","A good situation is to know that the enemy are unready and open whilst your own troops are fit and ready to go. Yet if you do not know thekinds of terrain you will face, then you still have a dilemma."
"Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.","Experience counts for a lot, although in war it can be hard to learn and possibly terminal if you err too far. If you do not have experience, then innovation can go a long way towards compensating for this limitation."
"Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.","Know your readiness, the enemy's readiness and the terrain, and you will know much that will determine victory and the tactics you should use. 'Heaven' implies factors such as the weather and spirit. 'Earth' is the more tangible terrain. Both and everything between should be considered."
Sun Tzu said: The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3) contentious ground; (4) open ground; (5) ground of intersecting highways; (6) serious ground; (7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desperate ground.,"There are nine types of ground as described below. Note that these are in addition to thesix kinds of terrain, although the types of ground described are often rather similar. See the next part for basic strategies to use on each of the nine types of ground."
"When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.","In your own territory, you should have an advantage, both knowing the ground and having friendly natives around."
"When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground.","Invading others, the early part of the invasion is easier because it is closer to home. Advantage may be gained when the enemy may be surprised. The enemy may also be indignantly ready and fight hard with a complete and highly motivated force."
"Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground.","There are always important places to hold, such as strategic hills, crossroads, towns and so on. These are where battles may be most fierce."
Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.,Between the contentious places lies open ground which may be difficult to win and difficult to hold. When fighting on open ground where surprise is difficult is likely to be helpful for the stronger force.
"Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.","One form of contentious ground is at the confluence of routes, where a resident force may prevent enemies traveling between many places. It is also a good place from which to launch campaigns in a variety of directions."
"When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.","When you have passed by enemy forces in places that are not easily taken, there is always a danger that they will appear at your rear. This requires additional vigilance and perhaps actions to keep them holed up."
"Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground.","Some land is just difficult, slowing you down if you wish to travel across it. Remember also that your enemy will also likely be slowed by such countryside, so do make use of this."
"Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.","Places where there is limited access make great fortresses, although it is also possible you may be trapped there. In a narrow corridor, troops may be faced only by an equal number. If additional defenses can be added, such as overlooking high ground, then this can become impregnable."
"Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.","Sometimes there is no shelter and no easy retreat. If you are confronted by the enemy, then you may have little alternative other than to fight or surrender. This is not a good place to stay for any time."
"On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not.","For theNine Varieties of Ground, here are simple rules. Avoid fighting in your own territory unless necessary. It is better to make the enemy realize they have no chance. When you are just inside enemy territory, keep going to build a buffer against your own borders. To fight and lose would result in repulsion or lay your lands open for attack. When on ground that is advantageous to both, defend it rather than sally forth to attack."
"On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.","When on ground where all can move easily, move quickly to deflect and redirect the enemy to places where you can beat them. At the confluence of routes, use alliances who have similar interests to control traffic."
"On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.","Where the enemy may come up behind you, take what you can and move on. Where the terrain slows you down, keep going, for to be caught and have to fight here could be hazardous."
"On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.","When there are narrow ways, use these to your advantage. When you have now way out, then you must fight. Note that fighting is the last thing you should do. It is better to maneuver and so win without losing lives."
"Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.","Thewedge is a classic tactic for breaking a defensive line. Like a nail penetrating a hard wood, a focused force can break through a strong defense. In physics, pressure is measured as force per unit area. This means a small force at a single point can still cause tremendous pressure. In war it is sometimes called 'divide and conquer'. A wedge from the side isolates the front-line troops from the rearguard, making each more vulnerable. The wedge can also be used in business, for example in breaking up competitive alliances."
"When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.","Unity and order are closely related. Hence if you divide their forces they will be inclined to disorder. One reason for this is that you may well be able to separate men from their commanders. Thus isolated, they will become like headless chickens."
"When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.","War is not just about advancing. It is about being in the place of greatest potential and advantage. This principle can result in movement in any direction, including going backwards or remaining still."
"If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: ""Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.""","Something that is 'held dear' implies an emotional attachment. When a person is attached to something, they make it a part of theiridentity. their self. Taking the attached thing is like stealing a part of their self. It feels like the basest abuse and creates anger, fear, loss and other strong emotions. In war this may be a beautiful city, a famed person, critical armaments and more. Greater than the sense of temporary loss is the fear that the taken item will be destroyed, leading to permanent loss and hence extinction of a part of the person. This threat can wean away any anger and lead to fearful compliance."
"Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.","War is a game of positioning. Where you are at any time is critical. In between, as you travel to these places, you are vulnerable. Speed hence reduces the chance of dangerous attack. Getting to strong positions earlier than the enemy expects also gives you the advantage of surprise and hence letting you attack them where they are weak. Speed also lets you travel in circuitous routes to avoid detection and yet arrive in time. Finally, speed gives you kinetic energy, which in physics is measured as half of the mass times the speed squared. An attack at speed hence is very powerful."
"The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.","When soldiers are close to home, any who are thinking of deserting may do so. But further away, this is not likely to be a successful option. Even if not considering desertion, troops keep a mental map of where they are and will naturally feel more isolated and fearful to some extent when further from home. The natural tendency at such times is to stick together as they are now clearly bound to a common fate of victory or likely capture or death. Now the troops depend on you, their leader. They look to you a a savior who will lead them to victory and then back home again."
Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.,"'An army marches on it's stomach' is a common truism. Fresh food will cheer the troops and help conserve supplies. Taking food in fertile country may also mean that you can allow enough left over for the local population. When passing through places, it does no harm to keep the locals onside."
"Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.","Whilst soldiers may expect to work hard, they are also biological machines which can be worn out by too much marching, fighting and stress. Understand the dynamics of the healthy body and, whilst keeping your troops fit (marching helps this), beware of wearing them down. In this way you can sustain energy for battle, wherever it appears. Unfathomable plans not only confuse the enemy, they also keep your own people on their toes and constantly ready for the next move."
"Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.","If soldiers may be motivated to fight less than their best, then the alternative of death will bring out the best in them. Even those who are motivated, will fight with an extra desperation when they believe there is no alternative. In this way, you may engineer situations where they believe there is no way back and so will fight on to the bitter end."
"Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.","This can also be seen in animals who are normally fearful and will run away, yet will fight like demons when cornered. The life drive is a natural instinct and we will each fight until our last breath. This can be seen in people who are dying in their beds as well as those on the battlefield."
"Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.","'qui vive' is seeking life. When soldiers see you as the route to survival, they will follow your orders without question. When they see no alternative, they will be unquestionably loyal."
"Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.","There are many superstitions about luck, in particular bad luck. When bad things happen, superstitious people assume they have not completed the right rituals and may go fatalistically to their deaths. When superstition is abolished, facts can be seen and accepted more easily. Then the right thing to do is also more easily accepted."
"If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.","Being a soldier is to face death, sometimes on a daily basis. This changes how you look at life. It is unsurprising in such situations that the live for the moment and think less of saving for a future than may never be. Soldiers do not sign up because they have a death wish. Nor do they often sign up for the booty. More often it is mundane, such as because they see no other prospects. Perhaps it is about seeking adventure. Maybe it is to do with seeking meaning. For some it might even be about king and country."
"On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.","Children are often shocked by the prospect of having to earn their living only on the last day of school. People who lose their jobs when a times get tough are often surprised, even though it it is clear redundancy is coming. Soldiers likewise may be horrified by the sudden realization that within a day they may be dead. The shock may well bring tears and it is good idea to let them weep away their terror. Yet, the next day, children become adults and those who lose their jobs get on with their lives. And soldiers, faced with death in all directions, step up to the mark and fight like heroes. In fact soldiers inculcated in the psychology of honor would rather die than be thought a coward. They fight for the person next to them, for their platoon, for their regiment. And to avoid at all costs the specter of dishonor."
"The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the Chung mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.","When a force is connected, all parts know what is happening with all other parts and can come to the rescue as needed. Or maybe one part can deliberately occupy the enemy whilst the other attacks the flanks. Such coordination and connection depends either on careful timing or, better, on excellent communications. Businesses can become so split up and with each unit so self-focused that competitors can win by picking off the units one by one. It is better to see the big picture and compete with coordinated action. A single attack can then be warded off by diverting resources from other units."
"Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.","Armies share a common fate as they win or fail together. Soldiers know this. Hence, even if there are internal rivalries, they know that it is in their best interests to work together and to come to the rescue even it there is significant loss. Of course this must be done with intelligence. There is no point throwing soldiers into a fray where they will lose."
"Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.","If you tether horses away from the battlefield, the soldiers cannot flee on horseback. If you bury chariot wheels, they cannot flee this way either. These are methods that were used to ensure soldiers fought on a common footing. Yet these are cynical methods and the horses and chariots could be used more constructively if you can trust your troops. This requires leadership. Leadership is important also in ensuring communication, coordination and acting as the snake of shuai-jan."
The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.,"The best way to set a standard is to model it. The next is to teach it. Then is to encourage it. Last is to enforce it. In practice you will likely need all of these, but should use more of the better ways. Without courage, an army will fail at the first hurdle. With great courage, they can overcome overwhelming odds. Courage should be allied with intelligence. Suicide is seldom a good choice, though in battle it is sometimes the best option for some so the war may be won."
How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is a question involving the proper use of ground.,"The secret of winning is to use everyone, playing to their strengths rather than forcing them to put forward only their weaknesses. Hence those who are not good fighters may be found more useful behind the lines, for example if they can run well then they may carry messages. If they are intelligent, they can process information. If they lack all skill then perhaps they can just carry things for you. It is a mark of leadership to be able to identify strengths and weaknesses and then play to the person's strength. In business, the 'Peter Principle' is that people get promoted to their level of incompetence and then remain there. In war even more than in business, this is a losing approach."
"Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.","An army or a business is made up of individual people. Whilst there is collective action, each is an independent agent. Hence, in order to gain a collective motivation, each person must receive the same message. Leaders hence must be constant in their purpose and copious in their communication."
"It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.","In war, intelligence is critical. This means your enemy will use all means, fair and foul, to learn of your plans. A secret shared is no longer a secret. Whilst some may be trusted, even the sharing may be overheard. The trusted person may also be captured and tortured for their knowledge. They may be blackmailed or bribed. The more critical the knowledge, the fewer should know. It is hence often better to keep major plans to oneself."
"He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.","A leader must communicate strongly to gain common purpose and coordinated action. But this does not mean laying bare all thoughts and intentions. Tell people what they need to know and enough to keep them motivated and coordinated. But then cloak further intent. People will naturally guess and will talk about their thoughts, which they will base on what you say and do. In this way, rumors will spread to enemy ears. When those rumors are wild and conflicting, the enemy will remain unsure and be unable to take positive action. Likewise in business, people like to gossip and may be intrigued by ideas. Uncertainty hence also keeps people on their toes, alert and ready. It is better to conduct the gossip orchestra than be the victim of it."
"By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.","Even if there is no leakage of information from your soldiers, you should assume that the enemy are watching you. Actions such as movements that have no particular purpose will be analyzed and purpose concluded. In this way, the true purpose may remain hidden and give the dual advantage of preventing readiness and creating surprise."
"At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.","Climbing heights and kicking away the ladder means removing the means of retreat. Likewise, when you are deep in enemy territory, desertion is not a wise option. There is the right time to show there is no way back, for it may be useful to let troops think this if it keeps them comfortable. But when a battle is to begin, all thought of retreat or desertion must be removed from their minds. In business, full personal commitment of everyone in the company makes a huge difference as compared with risk-averse cultures and where people have one eye on the door."
"He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.","Burning boats and bridges also removes the option to return. The notion of breaking cooking pots is that the only way to get food is to defeat the enemy and take theirs. There is much about drive, keeping the energy up and ready for battle. As in other moves, sustainingconfusion in this will keep the enemy uncertain and allow you to strike best at weakness."
To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may be termed the business of the general.,"In summary, this is what a leader does, choosing direction and motivating others to follow. In war, mustering is a combination of organizing and motivating, of giving purpose and creating readiness, even anxiety for fighting. When soldiers are sufficiently motivated they will face danger with a will. In business, whilst the danger is not mortal, it can still kill the company, leading its people to lose their livelihoods. As such it is still a very serious affair."
The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.,"TheNine Varieties of Ground have already been discussed and more is added here. 'Study' is an important word. It means gathering data, taking time, reflecting, considering different information, connecting disparate thoughts. It is not about a quick look or a five-minute ponder."
"When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.","A short distance into enemy territory is 'facile ground'. When deep into their territory, the threat all around pushes troops together and makes them more of a common mind. Closer to home, there may be different thoughts about what strategy should be, including going back home."
"When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.","'Critical ground' is not one of the nine varieties. When you just want to cross the territory of a non-enemy, this can annoy the territory owners. You may need to ask permission. You may also cross quickly or stealthily to avoid detection. Or else you may find yourself in an unwanted fight. At 'Intersecting highways' there are many routes that may be taken, making this a strategic position."
"When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.","In 'serious ground', the enemy is all around you, for example where you have passed by fortified places. This requires great caution. Facile ground is mentioned above."
"When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.","'Hemmed in' ground was previously described as 'Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths'. Enemy strongholds behind this makes it more difficult. On 'Desperate ground' you have to fight, now."
"Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.",'Dispersive ground' is in one's own territory. Unity of purpose can hence be 'defending the homeland'. 'Facile ground' is close to home. Keeping the army connected ensures that separate units do not go off on their own missions. It also helps manage a repulsive force from the invaded enemy.
"On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.","'Contentious ground' is that where 'the possession of which imports great advantage to either side'. You are likely to be attacked on this ground and so should not have a long straggle backwards, where units may be picked off by the enemy."
"On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.","On 'open ground', both sides can move quickly. Hence the need for vigilance. At crossroads, allies may be used to help hold this position."
"On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.","When the enemy is all around, you need to sustain supply levels as you never know when you may be cut off. 'Difficult ground' is hard and slow to cover, such as mountains and marshes. Such places are seldom worth holding unless they have some strategic value, and they are not comfortable, so it is best just to get through them."
"On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives.","In narrow ways, it is easy to protect your rear by blockage. It is also easy to stop fearful troops going backwards."
"For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.","When your back is against the wall, you have no option but to fight. When soldiers are confused, then they will obey commands with even more enthusiasm as they place blind trust in those who seem to know what to do."
"We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.","Alliances in warfare can be essential. They both provide assistance in your campaigns and also ensure the ally will not join the other side. Like business, however, a problem is that those who would be your friend often have an agenda of their own, which does not necessarily agree with yours. They may want large rewards for helping you, sharing in the spoils of a conquered land. They may want you to defend them from the others side. They may also have deceitful tricks up their sleeves, perhaps to invade your lands when you are gone or suddenly change sides when you are vulnerable. If you need to cross their lands, then they may help you, providing guides. Support from local people, even without a formal alliance, can be very useful."
To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince.,If you would be a prince or a respected leader then you have to show your dignity and adherence principles that are commonly held as being right for your position.
"When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.","It is a dangerous thing to attack a country which has many powerful allies. If they can act in coordination, you may quickly become outnumbered. Hence it is important not only to understand the depth of opposing alliances but also their military situations."
"Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.","Creating easy alliances makes one dependent on allies, who may themselves be quite unpredictable in warfare. Secrecy is much more difficult when allies are involved. If you cannot be sure with your own people, what hope that allies will keep secrets?Finally, if a general can succeed without allies, then their reputation will soar and their enemies will quake in fear."
"Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.","If you give rewards where they are expected, you just create a sense of entitlement. When you give rewards where they are not expected, you create surprise and delight. You also underline your absolute authority. Changing your mind is the officer's prerogative. It can be dangerous to think that once you have issued an order that it cannot be countermanded. Changing even for its own sake can also be used to keep the army on its toes. When everyone is now waiting on your next uncertain action, you have attention. When they know reward can easily be given, they wait in hope."
"Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.","When a deed is done or to be done immediately, there is no time for debate or dissent. It must be accepted. Emotions go in spirals, up or down. When people are feeling generally positive, they will see your plans in a positive light. When they are gloomy, they will be pessimistic."
"Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.",You see the best of people and armies when they have their backs to the wall and there is no options but to fight or otherwise face peril with a total dedication.
For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.,"The arousal that threat naturally creates can turn an average army into a powerful one. Being able to create and manage such situations is a mark of a clever general. In particular, whenFight-or-Flight is triggered, the skill is ensuring that only fight is chosen."
Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy's purpose.,"In both war and business, making plans without taking into account the actions of your enemy or competitors is likely to lead to failure. A good place to start with your own planning is your purpose. When analyzing the other side, purpose is also a good place to start. When you know what they seek to achieve you may better guess how they might seek to achieve it."
"By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief.","Senior officers seldom lead from the front and may often be found further back in the ranks. If you can determine their position and punch in from the side, you may be able to kill or capture them, hence 'beheading' the enemy and so creating fear and confusion."
This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.,Cunning is doing things that are not expected. It takes creativity and ingenuity as well as openness to ideas. Cunning in business is also a rare resource and some companies kill it with easy statements like 'that won't work'. Of course you must stay legal and must beware negative brand impact of sly tactics. Yet bold cunning can also make you look smart and successful.
"On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.",A new commander needs to make themselves felt. An easy way to do this is to countermand previous orders. The next step is to make positive commands that have an even better result.
"Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.",Senior officers are by nature bold and courageous and will bring this into meetings. To control such an abrasive group needs a strong and demanding commander.
"If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.","Take advantages of opportunities that the enemy affords. Do so also before they realize they have left an opening. Also beware that this is not done deliberately to lead you into a trap. Yet do not let constant fear of ambush prevent you from taking opportunities, many of which appear due to unforeseen circumstances or poor communications."
"Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.","If you hold what the enemy cares about, such as a key town that has cultural significance, then they will be cautious in case you harm it. You may hence be able to use it as a bargaining chip or to gain time. If you can control when and where the battles will occur then you can ensure you are better prepared and that the enemy is exhausted and unready."
"Walk in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.",Understand rules and why they are needed. Follow them when there is no reason not to do so. Move to avoid battle until you know that you can win.
"At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.","If you deliberately appear weak and unwilling to fight then the enemy may become bold and make unforced errors. When you strike, do so with speed such that the surprise created does not give them time to regroup or counter your moves."
Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.,"Incendiaries and fire-starting have been used for many centuries. Attack by fire is a fearsome thing. Not only is the heat dangerous but the smoke quickly clogs lungs. Smoke also reduces visibility and causes confusion. Burning in camps can be of tents, equipment and the ground or woods around. This is a direct attack on soldiers and causes great fear and confusion. Burning stores takes away vital supplies and hence causes great inconvenience, perhaps even forcing the enemy to retreat. Burning the supply line of baggage trains removes supplies in another way, preventing vital supplies from arriving and so causing confusion and uncertainty. Burning the arsenal deprives the enemy of their weapons. In modern warfare this causes great explosions which leads to further damage, confusion and fear. Finally, dropping fire upon the enemy wherever they are from a height is another fearful attack on soldiers. On the battlefield, it creates smoke and confusion."
"In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.",Using fire may be an opportunistic attack. It hence requires that you are always ready to use this fearsome device.
"There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.","Fires cause great fear as they destroy life and possessions and are difficult to control. When everything is wet, fires are difficult to start unless the thing to be fired is sheltered, such as arsenals. When fires are to be started should be chosen carefully. Strategic plans should also be taken into account, using fire as a part of an overall campaign."
"The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.","The best days for fires are when the trees and ground are dry enough for the fire to easily spread. Rising winds fan the flames and continued winds keep them going, feeding the fires with new oxygen. You should also only use fires when the winds will blow the smoke back into the enemy's eyes and not towards you. It is sometimes forgotten that smoke kills more people than flames, especially in an enclosed environment."
"In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments:",There are five factors described here which should be taken into account when attacking with fire.
"(1) When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without.","Fire in the camp may set the soldiers busy trying to put the fire out, making them vulnerable to external attack. Also, realizing this possibility, they may take to fanning out to find and punish the fire-starting culprits. In business, this principle may be described as attacking competitors when they are distracted."
"(2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.","Action is the natural response to a disturbance such as fire. If there is no action, then this is not natural. When the enemy behaves in any way that is not natural, they may be acting a cunning way, perhaps expecting you to use the alarm of the fire to attack them. If they are ready for you in their own camp, then attacking them could be hazardous for you. In business, when competitors act strangely, be suspicious."
"(3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.","When the flames are at their height, the enemy's disarray will also be at its height. If the flames are dying down, then they will be feeling calmer and be more ready to fight. Hence it is best to attack when there is most disarray. Attack after creating fire is not always a good idea, especially if you will be going into an unknown situation. Fires create fear and exhaustion all by themselves and so gain you advantage without your attack."
"(4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment.","You do not need to go into the enemy's camp to set the fire. You may be able to set this with projectiles in advance of your attack. Timing of the attack, as always, should coincide with the moment of greatest advantage."
"(5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.","Fires create smoke, which is blown by the wind. The fire also will travel in the direction of the wind. Hence you should be behind the fire, with the wind behind you, not in front of it. If the wind is swirling and unpredictable, starting a fire can be hazardous for you. It is always better to take action where the outcomes are more certain."
"A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.","Understand the nature of wind, and not just for fire. Winds can carry dust and other particles as well as smoke. Winds can also carry sounds and smells. Just as when tracking wild animals, it is better to be downwind than upwind."
"In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.","Understand fire and how to control it. Understood, it can be your ally. Movement of stars provides location information. Knowing where you are at all times is essential. A watch outwards lets you know more of what is happening all around you. The further you can see, the more land you can command."
Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.,"You should understand and be able to manage all of the elements to your greatest advantage. Water can be used in many ways, for example: - Rain provides cover for movement as the enemy cowers under cover - Fast-flowing, wide rivers are difficult to cross, creating useful barriers- Water underfoot creates mud that hampers both men and machines- Dammed water can be released to create a moving wall that sweeps away all in its path. In business, it may be remembered that resources for competing are all around you and that with a little creative thought you can gain significant competitive advantage."
"By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings.","Water does not destroy in the same way as fire, although it can still be very damaging."
Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.,"Commanders do not have a monopoly on ideas and innovation. There is much to be gained from the ingenuity of their people. This is a lesson that leaders continue to learn (and maybe not learn or re-learn) even today. Successful businesses leverage the talents of their people and do not assume that seniority equates with wisdom, omniscience and genius. Impoverished leaders manage by fear, leading to subordinates that blindly obey commands. Better is to have followers who implement the commander's intent with passion and commitment."
Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.,"To gain the spirit and action of enterprise requires the leader to actively encourage it and not (as many do) coldly suppress it. Cultivating resources also includes drawing out all kinds of talents from your people, from spying to devising new and cunning strategies and tactics. People learn what their leaders really want. Saying 'innovate' is like saying 'be spontaneous' -- it does not work. Better is to create the climate and culture that develops talent and focuses it in places where it will be most effective."
Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.,"There is a difference between action and advantageous action. A need to act without seeing the advantage of doing so greatly risks disadvantage. This applies to such as movement, using troops and fighting. Action without advantage is waste."
No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.,"It is not unknown for rulers to be ruled by their emotions more than their heads, though emotional decisions in war kills many people and may lose the war. The same happens with business managers who make decisions out of personal ambition or ill-founded 'gut feel'. This is a key reason why many Mergers & Acquisitions fail, despite expenditure of many millions."
"If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are.","Move when there is advantage to be gained and where this outweighs the ever-present risk of moving. The underlying principle is to constantly understand advantage and disadvantage, and to keep acquiring information that will give you the knowledge as to how to make this decision."
Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.,"Emotions do not stay. Anger fades, as does happiness, sadness and other emotions. We each have a temperamental level of good and bad feeling. So if you are moved to action by your feelings, wait."
But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.,"Whilst a kingdom may be built again, it is not the same kingdom and will never operate in quite the same way. Defeat changes people. So be careful in conquest, lest you destroy that which you seek to gain. When you spend the lives of soldiers, they are gone forever. Yet it is a commander's job to send people to their deaths. So do so wisely and for worthwhile advantage."
"Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.",Fight only when you need to. Destroy only that which you must. Seek always to avoid unnecessary damage and to bring the war to a rapid conclusion.
"Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.","War is very expensive. It costs in terms of lives, even when there is no fighting. It costs in the patience and support of the people at home. And it costs enormously in money. That cost is paid for long after the war is ended, even if you are the victor. You should understand the cost before you go to war and as you continue each day of warfare. Competing is also expensive in business. The cost of marketing, PR and sales can easily be far more than the cost of creating the product or delivering the service. When deciding what to offer, take all such expenses into account."
"Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.","War can be quite capricious, turning on a moment. Perhaps the greatest cost in war that may extend it endlessly or bring your rapid demise is your ignorance, your not knowing where the enemy is, their morale, their likely action and so on. The worst action of a commander is to imperiously take arrogant action for selfish reason, without consideration of the consequences for the troops or for the likelihood of winning or losing."
"One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.","To lead is a serious business in which personal foibles have no place. Paradoxically, the leader has to put themselves last, seeking first to win at the minimum cost. Glory is a result, not a goal. Those who seek glory are likely to find only ignominy. The same effect happens in business. Those who seek only profit at the expense of employee and customer satisfaction may succeed in the short term but will ultimately and massively fail."
"Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.","Knowledge is at the heart of all good decisions. Foreknowledge is knowing of future events. When this is not fully feasible, you can learn to forecast useful things such as the weather and the likely behaviors of opponents. What you should seek most of all is their very real strengths, deployment and plans. When you have real intelligence, this always beats vague guesswork."
"Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.","You can be bold and brash and have as much gut-feel as you like but if you do not base your decisions on sound data you are simply gambling. Even reasoning, if it is based on bad knowledge, will be fruitless. 'Garbage in, garbage out', as they say."
Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.,"The enemy does not want you to know anything about them, just as you will jealously guard your own information and plans. If you cannot get the knowledge by fair means, it must be gained by subterfuge, including the employment of spies and double agents."
"Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local spies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving spies.","There are five ways to spy, as described in the paragraphs below. Spying in business can border on unethical and easily cross the line. It can also become illegal. Having said this, gaining information on competitors in legal ways that are within company rules can give a significant advantage."
"When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called ""divine manipulation of the threads."" It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.","One of the most secret types of knowledge is about your spies. This should be known only by a very few at the top. If word leaks out, your enemy will be extra cautious and may put out false information. If they catch your spies then they may be tortured for information, may be turned against your and will likely be killed."
Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.,"Most people are just trying to get on with their daily lives. Wars are troublesome for them and can make life much harder. If the people where the enemy is residing do not like the enemy, then it should be easy to persuade bold individuals, especially those who have been wronged, to spy for you. This is the best type of local spy. If the local people are suffering hardship, then rewards of money or food may make it worth them taking risks for you. Worst is to coerce them into spying for you, for example by threatening to 'expose' them."
"Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.","A good spy, if you can turn him or her, is one who is trusted and who works within the enemy forces. Best of all is when they have access to plans and can overhear important discussions. Many people working in wars are co-opted into their position. Administrators, especially are not natural warriors and may resent being held under strict command. Inward spies may be gained by simple payment or, better, their simmering resentment may be amplified so they decide to side with you. This can be especially powerful if they believe you will win the war (so persuade them of such)."
"Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them for our own purposes.","If you can catch and turn the enemies spies, you then have a double-agent who you can get to send back false information and to tell you critical information, in particular about other spies (although spy networks are often organized to prevent such information being passed on). You may be able to persuade the spy to turn, or you may need to use a more coercive approach. The threat of harsh punishment may be sufficient for some. Beware of enemy spies pretending to be double agents or acting as triple agents. This is a murky world and you can never fully trust double agents."
"Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.","When one of your spies is lost, for example when they are compromised, you can still use this to your advantage, such as having deeper spies 'whisper' information about them to the enemy. In this way you may lose one spy but another gains greater confidence and access to better information."
"Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.","Spying is not a game for the faint of heart nor is it one where escaping detection and survival is likely to be gained, especially over the longer term. The only useful spies are those that provide information. The most useful ones are those who help you win the war in a shorter period and with less expenditure of resources."
Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.,"Keep your spies close. Know all that is to be known about them. Treat them well and make them feel important. Pay them well also, for their exploits and find every way to keep them motivated and loyal."
Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.,"Wisdom is about making the right decisions right. Spies are sharp and expensive instruments, so spend them well."
They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.,"Handling spies is a tricky business. While everyone knows that they could become double agents, they should not feel you suspect them of this. Look kindly on them with affection for their sacrifices."
"Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.","When spies make reports, they may not be accurate. They may have found weak information. They may have been discovered and fed false information. They may even have been turned to work against you. Seek to find ways of verifying what your spies whisper. Look for confirmation to other spies that the first spy does not know about."
Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.,"Spies are delicate tool. Crass use will expose them and ruin you, so be very careful. Spies can be used very creatively. You can use them in your own camp to seek out dissenters. You can use them with allies, to check on their loyalty. You can place them amongst the common folk to understand and nudge local populations. Well-used, spies can plant and provide information that catalyze and tip the balance. With small actions they can make big differences. Spying in business has the additional problem of possibly being illegal. If you step into this gray zone, you will need to be additionally careful."
"If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.","Timing in war is all-important, and especially so with spies. Secrecy is difficult to sustain and spies, who often hold critical information, can do great damage. Limiting damage may involve taking those who know out of the action. Killing may not be permitted now, but those who could ruin plans may be kept out of harm's way until the action is complete."
"Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.","When on a secret mission, the 'unimportant' people who are present along the way can become very important. They may see or overhear you and report their findings. They may also be persuaded to help, or at least not interfere. Such people often feel unloved and ignored. Using theirnames can by itself be enough to bring them to your side. Knowing them also gives opportunity for threat that can silence those who are too loyal to their own side to help you. In business, you likewise get a lot of information from receptionists, janitors and so on, who hear much and say little."
"The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.","When finding an enemy spy, it is tempting to interrogate and punish them harshly. Yet if you can turn them to your will, they can be immensely useful. Seek to understand the mentality of spies and how they are motivated. If they can be persuaded, bribed or otherwise motivated, use whatever will gain their greatest compliance. Do not spare expense in this, as the value the spy will bring may be far greater than any cost."
It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.,Spies from the other side know the enemy territory and people. One of their greatest contributions may be in finding and recruiting more spies in enemy territory and organizations.
"It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.","Where a spy's usefulness is ending, then you can make one last ploy by planting false information with them. It may be important that the spy does not know they are doomed and does not know they have false information. Hence when they are interrogated and give up their knowledge slowly, they will be believed."
"Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.","A spy who has gone deep and come back alive may have much knowledge that cannot just be written down. They hence may become advisors, commenting on critical plans and suggesting possible actions."
"The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.","Knowledge of the enemy, such as their plans, numbers, morale and so on may be guessed from distant observation. The certainty that a converted spy brings allows far more direct action and can end the war more quickly. To give up such information, it is far better to motivate the spy with reward than punishment. Interrogation leads to people telling you what they think you want to know. Proper motivation leads them to really want to help you."
"Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to I Chih who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.","There you go. Let's end with a bit of history. What it does say is that wisdom is rare, and if it is passed on, then whole dynasties will survive. When wisdom is lost, then dynasties fall and it may take many years and much hardship for the wisdom to be re-gained. It is a part of the foolishness of youth that the wisdom of their elders is not recognized."
"Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. Spies are a most important element in water, because on them depends an army's ability to move.","There is always a question as to what you do with your best people. Do you put them on the front line where they will have the greatest immediate effect? Or do you you them subtly and with care? Or even in training others to be more effective?As spying is the most powerful of tools, then it makes sense that you put the best people you have into this."
