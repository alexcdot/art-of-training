 brings it into the possession of the enemy, and then sweeps them out on his unsuspecting enemy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@(4) By dividing men into equal number, through novices to the senior officers; henceforth he is the general.~}When you must fight, you should always have the superior numbers. When there are too few, you should concentrate. When there are too many, you should send in the strongest forces. This is what you will do in business, where there are always so many to choose from. The principle is the same for all businesses: to have more people than is necessary to keep costs down. This is the spirit behind the seven key principles of competitive strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@(3) On the front line, lie far ahead of the enemy. On the back line, lie even further ahead.~}If you are far ahead in any given area, then the enemy will still be far behind you. In this way, you can hold off an attack with shorter distances. In business, you should consider both front and back ground before deciding whether to attack or away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^the-ground~@Therefore there is nothing in warfare more essential than to fight on the ground, subject to the knowledge that no one else will stand an equal fight.~}Ground has special importance in that it is both home and across which you can travel. War is one of these, so it is important that you can learn from them. At the same time, there is also a business value in sharing knowledge. Build and sustain relationships with your customers and suppliers who will spread the knowledge across all levels of the company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^the-enemy a-wisdom of-warrior~@Now a wise man will give orders to his attendants--his aides-de-camp--on his authority and without discrimination, and not only obey, but also avoid all incivility and sloth. Then he will be content and amenable to the will of his superiors and not slanderer nor easily provoked.~}Proper command is important, but underwinnable, particularly where there is peril in hand. If your orders are not to the best of their ability, then they should be to the best of their ability. When you must command, do so in a spirit of shared purpose and concern for your own officers and employees. In wartime there may be good reason for doing this, for example where the enemy is being overtaken by superior forces. In such situations you may make use of a variety of indirectives. When you say 'indirectives', do not mean 'using your mind'. You must have them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~^~@If at all possible, prepare in advance; to meet the mainforce should be advisable.~}On one hand, it is good to be prepared, but in the long run you should be able to defeat the mainforce first. On the other hand, you cannot let this be known, so prepare accordingly. This is why preparations are important, not just in the first battle but also in the later one.<|endoftext|>
