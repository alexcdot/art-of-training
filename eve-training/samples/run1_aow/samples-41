 our fight. He will not defeat himself or his soldiers; he will only fight his own cause. --Albert Einstein
<|startoftext|>~^~@We should beware, lest in our fighting ways come defeat we may be doomed.~}There is always the possibility of defeat and there is always risk in taking risks. The same is true for humans. Whilst you may gain or lose the war by taking risks in battle, this also does not equal victory. There is still time for both sides to do the right thing and so stay on top of important developments. The same is true for ourselves and for each other. It is good to know you are much stronger when you are much weaker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^two-men~@In our fighting ways, there is no doubt that in defeating ourselves, one will meet an enemy who is more powerful than ourselves; yet neither will the other face our enemy more unfavourably.~}In general, war is won or lost by two or more men. In business, both are competitors with no certainty of success; neither is a simple matter of taking different paths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^one-man~@If, on the one hand, it is possible to defeat an army of equal strength, such a victory will be obtained, but if at other times it will be impossible, then it will be impossible; if it is easy to defeat an army of equal strength, its defeat will be much more difficult.~}Experience shows that war is won and lost by two or more people. A victory gained is likely to cause people to give in to temptation and give in to defeat, just as when a successful leader creates a new culture with new ways of thinking. Winning also appears to come from the heart--the feeling of being well-disciplined and well-travelled. The same is true for motivation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~^persuasive a~@On the one hand a man who will fight is impassible; on the other, he has lost all confidence.~}When an army is exhausted or has lost all trust within itself, it is tempting to resort to disorder. In both cases, though, it is better to face defeat with the same resolve as if you were fighting. This is why one should set high goals, such as defeating an overwhelming enemy, than to seek defeat where none remains.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^delay ground~@When we have taken certain measures, we are not able to keep the enemy at a distance.~}There is no certainty of victory on the ground, but when one takes the initiative there it is obvious what is at hand. When a force is isolated, it is easy to see where it will be strongest or weakest. At the same time, the more isolated troops are they more likely to concentrate their strength elsewhere. The same is true for ground where it is difficult to sustain troops on short term footing.<|endoftext|>
