 weatherful, the enemy will not let you cross his frontier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^dispersive~@When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground.~}In your own territory, you should have an advantage, both knowing the ground and having friendly natives around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^shepherd~@He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.~}Burning boats and bridges also removes the option to return. The notion of breaking cooking pots is that the only way to get food is to defeat the enemy and take theirs. There is much about drive, keeping the energy up and ready for battle. As in other moves, sustainingconfusion in this will keep the enemy uncertain and allow you to strike best at weakness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~^hands the-opportunity opportunity~@To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.~}If you have a good defense, you will survive attacks. If you have a weak defense, then even a moderate attack may well succeed. The same is true for your enemy. Understand their defense to know how hard or easy it will be to defeat them. This is the principle of the feint, where a false attack triggers a defensive move that also exposes a weakness. In business, you can make small competitive moves just to see how your competitors react. You can then plan a more effective campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^raise supplies~@With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. Then, when the enemy has occupied them, you will be able to fight with advantage.~}Accessible ground need not be level, just easy to traverse. Within this, some places will be more advantageous than others. These are worth occupying first. In accessible ground you may travel far, creating the need for a long and vulnerable supply line which your enemy may try to sever. Effort should be put into protecting this life-giving umbilical cord.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.~}To avoid losing, you must be able to defend. Knowing this, you can spend too much on building a strong defense. To win, however, you must be able to attack. And so you must also plan and prepare for winning attacks. Chang Yu said: "Attack is the secret of defense; defense is the planning of an attack. "<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~^the-result~@Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.~}There are many variables and tactics in war that a general can use. The most primitive approach is for the two armies to meet on a battlefield and just throw themselves at each other. When it is simple force against simple force like this, then the laws of physics say that the greater force will win. This can seem like a strong and honorable approach yet vanity in war is more like foolishness.
