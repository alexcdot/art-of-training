 bay~@When an enemy leaves a garrison post, he is gone; when his antagonists besiege walled cities, they are gone.~}Laying siege to a strongly defended position is poor in many ways. It is likely to drag on for a long time. It is hard work and takes much resource. Your troops are exposed while theirs are hidden. The sheer cost of siege makes it a final option only.<|endoftext|>

In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.~}Keep your spies close. Know all that is to be known about them. Treat them well and make them feel important. Pay them well also, for their exploits and find every way to keep them motivated and loyal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~^~@If asked how to best rouse a general, I should say, that he is Hieronymus Bos, the Great Spirit.~}Bos is the greatest of generals, who has been called the "Humble Virgin". He is the master of ceremonies and the arbiter of honor. In business he is perhaps best understood as a manager who codes and codes rewards and punishments. Those who are seen as more competent than him deserve respect. MBA students learn how to set up successful companies by ear, study how to avoid five problems and more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~^the-general his-presence~@To cause a general to be aware of another's purpose and ability, is to cause him to be vigilant and to be ready for battle.~}The 'knowing' person, as they work together, will ensure that the right decisions are taken and that the right allies are made. With little collective action, each mistake will be felt fully by the commander-in-chief. Impoverished leaders create disunity and division in the first place. The first step in bringing about the intended effect is a disarray of resources and decisions. When such disorder is reached, the troops turn to one resource only--War. When it is too late to fight, the troops go to work to restore order.<|endoftext|>
