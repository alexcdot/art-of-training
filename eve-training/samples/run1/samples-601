 very important. Even though they lack initiative, they clearly care about you and care about the land they serve. It is easy in business for a small company to be taken advantage of. Even small regulations can have a significant cost. See the cost at the end of this article for why it is important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@These six are the principles connected with Earth.~}At the root of all problems is understanding the limits of the possible. In physics there are three types of uncertainty:
1. Uncertainty is angle, space and time. 2. Uncertainty is direction. and 3. Uncertainty is strength. For understanding these, it is best to think creatively. In locales where there are other challenges, such as high rivers, take advantage of local conditions and nature. 3. Uncertainty is information. If you can send signals that cannot be intercepted, then the enemy can prepare to respond by deception, for example by pulling up a ravine that has no access to water. In business, if you can anticipate competitive action and can wait until the situation calls for it, you have a great advantage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~^wait defeat~@When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.~}An enemy that does not attack or does not flee is likely confident where they are. If you cannot see their advantage, be very wary. It is also possible that they can see no advantageous action. To know this, look for signs of confusion in their camp. In business, if a competitor is not taking competitive action, ask yourself why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.~}These are but two examples, and yet each deserves attention. When an opponent is close to you and does not wish to fight, then you can cause their true strength to be hidden in plain sight. By distancing yourself from their innermost thoughts, you can ensure that your deepest fears are unravelled. In this way, a thousand futures are formed into one concentrated force. Better is to create a powerful drive that drives home the point that way too much effort is put into building walls and canardings are not true lessons. In business, drive is a critical part of sales where brash tactics can lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@Such are the provisions of a Caspian straits.~}It is better to understand the surplice of a strait than to attack it. Attack bubbles form when there is dust rising and when the wings are compressed. Dust collects in difficult ground and falls easily on the unprepared. It is a common and effective tactic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.~}Fighting a strong force is a good way of losing troops, yet many combatants have thought the only way to win is through direct conflict. There are many alternatives and only a fool dashes himself against a rock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.~}You not only need to know things, you have to use them in the right way. Both of these steps have to be made. History is littered with failures to understand and failures to apply what is understood.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~^~@To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.~}Striking at the enemy requires good timing. Panicked troops or those
