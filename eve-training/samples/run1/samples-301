 watch as the enemy steadily marches, then the only alternative is to surrender."~}The end of a long war is not good for your reputation. It signals failure. Successful campaigns are littered with campaigns that were well-managed and with rewards for hard work. It is easy in business to cheerleaders for their tenacity, but it is much harder in competition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the slightest disturbance of the enemy's way requires the intervention of the State.~}Generals are not perfect. The best soldiers are not necessarily the best leaders. They are likely both and they will trade insults over this. Understand the greater potential for mismanagement and other unwise decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^difficulty~@In hemmed-in warfare, then, make no secret of the fact that you will defend against all; in hemmed-in attack, then, wait at a distance;--this is the art of overcoming obstacles.~}History is full of failures to understand and failures to anticipate such failures. If you are not ready for the test, then the next is much harder and so on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.~}When there is nothing to move about, you must fight. If you cannot move quickly, you must fight in confusion. If you are in a strongly-willed defensive stance, then the enemy will have little time to take these three actions on their own terms. In war, this is where defensive thinking is most useful. They can see an army in a wisp of fire and react accordingly. Taking defensive stances allows you to keep them bound behind their backs, which gives them an opening to attack. When they are bound behind your back, they are vulnerable and cannot move or talk to you. It is in their neutral nature that attackers will attack, and they will panic and move at a rapid pace to avoid you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~^able~@The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of whether they are soldiers, civilians, or makers of chariots.~}When a ruler acts in a moral way, showing fairness in all dealings and caring for the subjects, then the subjects willreciprocate, caring in return even to the point of death. Love begets love. Moral law is also related to harmony and ensuring alignment in all things. In business, a perform-or-perish, hire-and-fire attitude may seem good for business but does not lead to loyal employees. If you clearly care about your people they will care about you and care about the business. Leadership begets followership.<|endoftext|>
