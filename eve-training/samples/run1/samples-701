 if you let them get away. And even if they are strong, when they are cornered, they will fight on their own account. To fight on your own account is the breaking down of bonds, the replacement of forces, the draining of the gorges, the complete and total withdrawal of all our supplies.~}Here are five things to keep in mind when you are seeking to fight in the Summer. 1. Rain provides camouflage and energy. If you stay in high places, you can constantly see an advancing army. If you stay in low places, you may suffer a humiliating defeat. 2. Rain provides depth and comfort. Benevolence is by nature a timid warrior. If he or she is startled, they may be paralyzed by fright. When they are sufficiently moved, they may willingly give in and fight on their own account. 3. Water provides cover and protection. Underwater cities give easier movement as the need for cover may be different for each. 4. Water can be used in many ways, for example: - Rain provides energy that even the strongest of fighters is destroyed. When the enemy is cut off,   the cover created by the river deltsoilsglers can hold together for long before they are used up. }In physics, cover does not equal destruction. Dispersive fighting removes those who can move and lets you fire down on their positions. Dispersive tactics are like bulldozers, finding ways around defensive methods to move fire destruction everywhere. When you are down, you can still use the same tactics again, this time to greater advantage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^the-subtlest-blend~@The subtle differences that distinguish the branches of a tree from the swamps of a country make it a point of study to determine the spots where to sow and where to pack our encampment.~}When to sow: who knows where the troops will be on their way to fighting. There are also places where good planting can be needed. Best to plan accordingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^the-whole-army army face~@Camp in the face of a large force, then move up and down the scale, so that there is no difficulty in wresting a single drop of blood from your enemy.~}When there are hostile beasts on the move, it is important that they be treated with humanity and fairness. Troops are clearly aggressive when they are fearful and will come to the rescue even at the edge of an army. When they see that your troops are in a position to naturalise, they will show a greater sense of resolve and will seek to prevent you doing the same. In this positive energy we can all become loyal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@By applying the Five Constantists principles to the operations of a battleship, she will be able to determine the proper days and months for each, and her calculations to be able to meet the coming of the enemy on the day she arrives.~}Matches are won by the hand. It is why armies are used to fighting in mid-day when they start planning and knowing nothing of the coming counter-attack until it actually appears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^death unknown~@Thus the good fighter is unable to make a single kick in his opponent's direction, while the dangerous artist strikes at a single nail deep in his opponent's, and does not penetrate into their body; while the powerful captain shapes his maneuvers in relation to the coming of the enemy.~}Concern for the safety of the party and the well-being of the enemy is important here. In business, underhanded tactics are likely to succeed where delicate business communications go unreadily into enemy territory. Packing up also gives control whilst hiding your true desires. In business as in war, take advantage of opportunities and avoid being caught out in both. Ensuring your people are constantly on the same page is a core business skill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.~}If you can avoid the elements and use fire only when necessary, you can travel far, fight many battles than people think they can see, and still survive. The same problem faces business. When there is too much doing, they lash out. When they are too busy trying to do right things, they make decisions based on bad data and knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced,
