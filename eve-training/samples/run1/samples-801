 bellies. The ability to see possibilities and take your organisation there is a rare resource amongst warriors. There is much about business, politics and so on that is not discussed or debated. In business, openness to ideas is a core ten principle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.~}Cunning is doing things that are not expected. It takes creativity and ingenuity as well as openness to ideas. Cunning in business is also a rare resource and some companies kill it with easy statements like 'that won't work'. Of course you must stay legal and must beware negative brand impact of sly tactics.

<|startoftext|>~^destruction~@There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.~}Here are five sins or faults that must be avoided. 1. Recklessness is making decisions based on anger, hope or other dangerous emotions. It is better to make decisions using knowledge and facts. 2. In war you cannot but make decisions. A decision not to fight when it is necessary leads to flight and capture and losing all the same. Not only does cowardice lose the war, it also results in shame and dishonor. 3. A commander or simple soldier who is easily provoked is one who is easily defeated by the cunning enemy. Provocation which leads to anger also leads to hasty action and falling into traps. 4. A sense of honor is mostly a good thing, but it can be hazardous when the thought of shame leads to losing actions, such as entering into a battle that cannot be won. 5. Caring for your soldiers is also a good thing unless taken to excess, whereby fear for their safety can lead to unwise strategic decisions. In war, generals must be ready to send their soldiers to their deaths in order to achieve the greater goal of victory. These rules apply to business too, where recklessness and other foolhardiness can be very expensive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>~^~@Anger may in time change to gladness.~}Emotions do not stay. Anger fades, as does happiness, sadness and other emotions. We each have a temperamental level of good and bad feeling. So if you are moved to action by your feelings, wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>~^~@By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.
